<h5>MR. CHURCHILL'S IDEAS ARE MONASTIC.</h5>
<br>
<p>The office of the <i>Statesman</i> daily journal was not popular with the
neighbours, although its existence unquestionably caused a diminution of rent in
its immediate proximity. It was very difficult to find--which was an immense
advantage to those connected with it, as no one had any right there but the
affiliated; and strangers burning to express their views or to resent imaginary
imputations cast upon them had plenty of time to cool down while they wandered
about the adjacent lanes in vain quest of their object. If you had business
there, and were not thoroughly acquainted with the way, your best plan was to
take a sandwich in your pocket, to prepare for an afternoon's campaign, and then
to turn to the right out of Fleet Street, down any street leading to the river,
and to wander about until you quite unexpectedly came upon your destination.
There you found it, a queer, dumpy, black-looking old building,--like a
warehouse that had been sat upon and compressed,--nestling down in a quaint
little dreary square, surrounded by the halls of Worshipful Companies which had
never been heard of save by their own Liverymen, and large churches with an
average congregation of nine, standing mildewed and blue-mouldy, with damp
voters'-notices peeling off their doors, and green streaks down the stuccoed
heads of the angels and cherubim supporting the dripping arch over the porch, in
little dank reeking churchyards, where the rank grass overtopped the broken
tombstones, and stuck nodding out through the dilapidated railing.</p>
<p>The windows were filthy with the stains of a thousand showers; the paint had
blistered and peeled off the heavy old door, and round the gaping chasm of the
letter-box; and in the daytime the place looked woebegone and deserted. Nobody
came there till about two in the afternoon, when three or four quiet-looking
gentlemen would drop in one by one, and after remaining an hour or two, depart
as they had come. But at night the old house woke up with a roar; its windows
blazed with light; its old sides echoed to the creaking throes of a huge
steam-engine; its querulous bell was perpetually being tugged; boys in paper
caps and smeary faces and shirt-sleeves were perpetually issuing from its
portals, and returning, now with fluttering slips of paper, now with bibulous
refreshment. Messengers from the Electric Telegraph Companies were there about
every half-hour; and cabs that had dashed up with a stout gentleman in
spectacles dashed away with a slim gentleman in a white hat, returning with a
little man in a red beard, and flying off with the stout gentleman again. Blinds
were down all round the neighbourhood; porters of the Worshipful Companies,
sextons of the congregationless churches, agents for printing-ink and Cumberland
black-lead, wood-engravers, box-block sellers, and the proprietors of the
Never-say-die or Health-restoring Drops, who held the corner premises,--were all
sleeping the sleep of the just, or at least doing the best they could towards
it, in spite of the reverberation of the steam-engine at the office of the <i>
Statesman</i> daily journal.</p>
<p>On a hot night in September Mr. Churchill sat in a large room on the
first-floor of the <i>Statesman</i> office. On the desk before him stood a huge
battered old despatch-box, overflowing with papers--some in manuscript, neatly
folded and docketed; others long printed slips, scored and marked all over with
ink-corrections. Immediately in front of him hung an almanac and a packet of
half-sheets of note-paper, strung together on a large hook. A huge waste-paper
basket by his side was filled, while the floor was littered with envelopes of
all sizes and colours, fragments cut from newspapers, ink-splashes, and piles of
books in paper parcels waiting for review. A solemn old clock, pointing to
midnight, ticked gravely on the mantelpiece; a small library of grim old books
of reference, in solemn brown bindings, with the flaming cover of the
Post-Office Directory like a star in the midst of them, was ranged against the
wall; three or four speaking tubes, with ivory mouthpieces, were curling round
Mr. Churchill's feet; and Mr. Churchill himself was reading the last number of
the <i>Revue de Deux Mondes</i> by the light of a shaded lamp, when a heavy hand
was laid on his shoulder, and a cheery voice said,</p>
<p>&quot;Still at the mill, Churchill? still at the mill?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, Harding, my dear fellow, I'm delighted to see you!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I should think you were,&quot; said Harding, laughing; &quot;for my presence here
means a good deal to you,--bed, and rest, and country, eh? Well, how have you
been?--not knocked up? You've done capitally, my boy! I've watched you
carefully, and am more than content.&quot; (For Mr. Harding was the editor of the <i>
Statesman</i>, and Churchill, one of his principal contributors, had been taking
his place while he made holiday.)</p>
<p>&quot;That's a relief,&quot; said Churchill. &quot;I've been rather nervous about it; but I
thought that Tooby and I between us had managed to push the ship along somehow.
Tooby's a capital fellow!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; said Mr. Harding, seating himself; &quot;Tooby is a capital fellow,
and there's not a better 'sub' in London. But Tooby couldn't have written that
article on the Castle-Hedingham dinner, or shown up the <i>Teaser's</i> blunders
in classical quotation, Master Frank. <i>Palman qui meruit</i>. Who did the
Bishops and the Crystal Palace?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Slummer wrote those. Weren't they good?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very smart; very smart indeed. A thought too strong of Billingsgate, though.
That young man is a very hard hitter, but wants training. Where's Hawker?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just gone. He's been very kind and very useful, so have Williams and Burke,
and all. And you--how have you enjoyed yourself?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Never so much in my life. I've read nothing but the paper. I've done nothing
but lie upon the beach and play with the children.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And the children--are they all right? and Mrs. Harding?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Splendid! I never saw the wife look so well for the last six years. She sent
all kind remembrances to you, and the usual inquiry.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What! if I was going to be married? No, no; you must take back my usual
answer. She must find me a wife, and it must be one after her own pattern.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Seriously, Frank Churchill, it's time you began to look after a wife. In our
profession, especially, it's the greatest blessing to have some one to care for
and to be petted by in the intervals of business-strife. There used to be a
notion that a literary man required to be perpetually 'seeing life,' which meant
'getting drunk, and never going home;' but that's exploded, and I believe that
our best character-painters owe half their powers of delineation to their wives'
suggestions. Women,--by Jove, sir!--women read character wonderfully.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mrs. Harding has made a bad shot at mine, old friend,&quot; said Churchill,
laughing, &quot;if she thinks that I am in any way desirous to be married. No, no! So
far as the seeing life is concerned, I began early, and all that has been over
long since. But I've got rather a queer temper of my own. I'm not the most
tolerant man in the world; and I've had my own way so long, that any little
missy fal-lals and pettishness would jar upon me horribly. Besides, I've not got
money enough to marry upon. I like my comforts, and to be able to buy occasional
books and pictures, and to keep my horse, and my club, and--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, but a fellow like you might pick up a woman with money!&quot; said Harding.</p>
<p>&quot;That's the worst pick-up possible,--to have to be civil to your wife's
trustees, or listen to reproaches as to how 'poor papa's money' is being spent.
No, no, no! So long as my dear old mother lives, I shall have a decent home; and
afterwards--well, I shall go into chambers, I suppose, and settle down into a
club-haunting old fogey.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Stuff, Frank; don't talk such rubbish. Affectation of cynicism and
affectation of premature age are two of the most pernicious cants of the day.
Very likely now at the watering-place to which you're going for your holiday,
you'll meet some pretty girl who--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Watering-place!&quot; cried Frank, shouting with laughter; &quot;I'm going to my old
godfather's country place for some partridge-shooting; and as he's an old
bachelor of very peculiar temper, there's not likely to be much womankind
about.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ho, ho! A country place, eh? and partridge-shooting? Hum, hum! We're coming
out. Don't get your head turned with grand people, Frank.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Grand people!&quot; echoed Churchill. &quot;Don't I tell you the man's my godfather?
There will probably be half a dozen men staying in the house, whose sole care
about me will be that I carry my gun properly, and don't hit them out in the
stubble.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;When do you go?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To-morrow, by the midday express. I've some matters to settle in the
morning, and can't get down before dinner-time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, then, get to bed at once. I've got to say a few words to Tooby; and
I'll see Marks when he comes up with the statement, and take care that all's
straight. You've seen your own proofs? Very well, then; God bless you! and be
off, and don't let us see your face for a month.&quot;</p>
<p>They shook hands warmly; and as Churchill left the room, Harding called after
him, &quot;Two things, Frank: look out for a nice wife, and don't get your head
turned with what are called 'swells.'&quot;</p>
<p>Throughout London town there breathed no simpler-minded man than George
Harding. At College, as in after-life, he had lived with a very small set,
entirely composed of men of his own degree in the world; and of any other he had
the vaguest possible notion. His intellectual acquirements were great, and his
reading was vast and catholic; but of men and cities he had seen literally
nothing; and as, except in his annual vacation, when he could go down with his
family and potter about the quietest of watering-places, he never went any where
save from his home to the <i>Statesman</i> office, and from the <i>Statesman</i>
office to his home, he was not likely to enlarge his knowledge of life.
Occasionally, on a Saturday night in the season, he would get the Opera-box from
the musical critic, and would take Mrs. Harding to Her Majesty's; but there his
whole attention would be absorbed in contemplating the appearance and manners of
the &quot;swells,&quot;--the one word not to be found in the dictionary which he sometimes
indulged in. Slightly Radical in his opinions was George Harding; and that he
was not much gratified by his observation of these specimens of the upper ten
thousand, was to be traced in certain little pungencies and acerbities in his
leading articles after these Opera visits. He worshipped his calling, in his own
honest, simple, steadfast way, and resented, quietly but sturdily, any attempts
at what he considered patronage by those of higher social rank. The leaders of
his political party, recognisant of the good service done to them by Harding's
pen, had, on several occasions, essayed to prove their gratitude by little set
civilities: huge cards of invitation to Lady Helmsman's Saturday-evening
reunions had found their way to the <i>Statesman's</i> deep-mouthed letter-box;
carriage-paid hampers of high-flavoured black game sped thither from the
Highland shooting-box, where the Foreign Secretary was spending his hard-earned
holiday; earliest intimation of political changes, in &quot;confidential&quot; covers,
were conveyed there by Downing-Street messengers. But George Harding never
appeared at Protocol House; his name was never seen low down amongst those of
the Foreign-Office clerks and outer selvage of fashion, chronicled with such
urbanity by Mr. Henchman of the <i>High-Life Gazette</i>; and no attention or
flattery ever made him pander to a shuffle, or register a lie. He had a very
high opinion of Churchill's talents and honour; but he knew him to be fond of
praise, and, above all, greatly wanting in discretion. Harding had seen so many
men full of promise fall into the dreary vortex of drink and debt and pot-house
dissipation, that he had hailed with delight the innate decency and gentlemanly
feeling which had kept Frank Churchill out of such dirty orgies; but now he
feared lest the disinfectant might prove even worse than the disease itself; and
lest the aristocratic notions, which his friend undoubtedly possessed, might
lead him into society where his manliness and proper pride might be swallowed up
in the effulgency of his surroundings.</p>
<p>So mused George Harding, bending over the dingy old grate at the <i>Statesman</i>
office, and gazing vacantly at the shavings with which it was filled, while
waiting for Mr. Marks, the head printer, to bring him the &quot;statement,&quot; showing
the amount required to fill the paper. Meanwhile Churchill, cigar in mouth, was
striding through the deserted streets, rejoicing in the thought of his coming
holiday, and inwardly chuckling over his friend's warnings. At last he stopped
at a door in a dull respectable street leading out of Brunswick Square, let
himself in with a latch-key, drank a tumbler of soda-water, and glanced at the
addresses of some letters in his little dining-room, exchanged his boots for
slippers at the bottom of the staircase, and crept slowly up the stairs. As he
arrived at the second floor, he paused for a minute, and a voice said, &quot;God
bless you, Frank!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;God bless you, mother!&quot; he replied; &quot;good night, dear;&quot; and passed into his
room.</p>
<p>Then he sat himself on the side of his bed, and began leisurely to undress
himself, smiling meanwhile.</p>
<p>&quot;Bring back a wife, and beware of swells, eh? That is the essence of
Harding's advice. No, no my darling old mother; you and I get on too well
together to change our lives. An amusing time a wife would have with me,--out
half the night at the office, and she shivering in the dining-room waiting my
return. Wife, by Jove! Yes; and thick fat chops, and sixteen-shilling trousers,
and the knifeboard of the omnibus instead of the cob to ride on! No; I think
not. And as for swells--that old republican, Harding, thinks every man with a
handle to his name is an enemy to Magna Charta. I should like to show him my old
godfather walking into an idiotic peer of the realm!&quot;</p>
<p>And, very much tickled at the idea, Churchill put out his candle and turned
in.</p>

<h5>DOWN AT BISSETT.</h5>
<p>At the very first sign of the season's breaking up, Sir Marmaduke Wentworth
was in the habit of leaving his town-house in Curzon Street, and proceeding to
his country-seat of Bissett Grange. Gumble, his butler and body-servant, was the
first person officially informed of the intended flight; but long before his
master spoke to him, that far-seeing man had made up his mind, and arranged his
plans accordingly. &quot;Flitherses gone to-day, eh!&quot; he would say to himself, as, in
the calm, cool evening, he lounged against the jams of the street-door (Gumble
was never seen in the area) and looked up to the opposite house. &quot;Shutters up,
and Flitherses hoff! Some German bath or other, no doubt; elber-shakin' for the
old man, and forrin' counts for the young ladies. Lord Charles leff last week;
he'll be takin' his rubber at Spaw now as natural as at the Club. The old Berrin
has been sent away somewheres; and I'll bet a pound in two days my guv'nor says
Hoff!&quot; And he would have won his bet. So soon as there was the slightest
appearance of a move among the people of his circle; so soon as he found &quot;shall
have left town&quot; given as an answer to an invite to one of his cosey little
dinners; before Goodwood afforded the pleasantest excuse for the laziest of
racing and the happiest of lunching; while flannel-clad gentlemen yet perspired
copiously at Lord's, defending the wickets of Marylebone against the predatory
incursions of &quot;Perambulators&quot; or &quot;Eccentrics;&quot; when Finsburyites were returning
from their fortnight at Ramsgate, and while Dalstonians yet lingered on the pier
at Southend,--old Marmaduke Wentworth would give his household brigade the order
to retreat, and, at their head, would march down upon Bissett Grange.</p>
<p>And he was right; for there was not a nobler old house, nor prettier grounds,
in the broad county of Sussex, where it stood. Contrast is the great thing,
after all: tall men marry short women; the most thickset nursery-maids struggle
a-tiptoe to keep step with the lengthiest members of the Foot-Guards; Plimnims
the poet, who is of the Sybarite-roseleaf order, sighs for Miss Crupper the <i>
écuyère</i>, who calls a horse an oss, and a donkey a hass; and so you, if you
had been staying at Brighton, and had gone on an excursion at half-a-crown an
hour into the inner country, would have fallen in love with Bissett Grange. For,
weary of the perpetual hoarse murmur of the sea, now thundering its rage in
tremendous waves, now shrieking its lamentation in long hissing back currents;
sick of the monotony of the &quot;long-backed bushless downs,&quot; so cold and bare and
wind-swept, echoing to the eternal plaint of the curlew, and shutting off the
horizon with a dreary never-ending shoulder-blade of blank turf,--you, if you
were lucky in your choice, and had a driver with a soul beyond the Steine and
aspirations exceeding the Lewes Road, would have come upon, at a distance of
some five miles from Brighton, a little one-storied porter's lodge, nestling in
ivy so deep that the dear parasite had it in its embrace, chimneys and all. Big,
heavy, and wooden were the lodge-gates; none of your pretty, light, elegant
Coalbrookdale innovations. Gates, in Sir Marmaduke Wentworth's idea, were things
to keep impertinent prying people out; and as such they could not be made too
cumbrous or too opaque for his pleasure. They were very high as well as very
heavy; so, if you had come with your 'cute driver in your fly excursion, you
would have seen nothing but the quaint twisted chimneys; and even for that view
you must have mounted unto the box. Save the friends of the owner, no one, in
Marmaduke Wentworth's time, had ever passed the lodge, or rather, I should say,
reached the house. Visitors to. Brighton and Worthing, dying of <i>ennui</i>,
had besieged the lodge' and implored permission to walk in the grounds; artists
had asked to be allowed to sketch the house; a &quot;gentleman engaged upon the
press&quot; had written to say that he was sure there must be a legend connected with
some chamber, if he might only be permitted to explore the mansion; and one man,
a photographer, bribed the lodge-keeper's grand-daughter with a piece of
elecampane, and, in the absence of the legitimate portress passed the gate. He
had proceeded about a couple of hundred yards up the avenue, when he was met by
Sir Marmaduke, who had just turned out for his leisurely afternoon ride. The
sight of the itinerant professor with his travelling camera roused the old
gentleman in an instant; he set spurs to his cob, hurried off to the intruder,
and tapped him smartly on the back with his whip. One instant's glance revealed
to him the whole affair: it was <i>not</i> a travelling Punch, whom he would
have sent into the kitchen; it was <i>not</i> a man from the Missionary Society,
whom he would have had ducked in the pond; it was--<i>tant soit peu</i>--an
artist; and for art of any kind, however humble, old Marmaduke had a regard. So
when the trembling man looked up, and, divided between a notion of &quot;cheeking the
swell,&quot; or being impudent, and running away, or being cowardly, hit upon a
middle course, and, guarding his head, at which nothing had been aimed,
exclaimed, &quot;Now, then! What are you at? Who's hurting you?&quot; all the old
gentleman did was to bend from his saddle, to seize the intruder by the lobe of
his ear, to turn him completely round, and, pointing to the gate, to utter in a
hissing whisper the phrase &quot;Go away, man!&quot;</p>
<p>When the photographer attempted to explain, the ear-pressure was intensified,
and the &quot;Go away, man!&quot; uttered more loudly; at the third repetition, the
photographer wrung his ear from the old gentleman's fingers, and ran away
abjectly.</p>
<p>&quot;Collodion and Clumpsoles; or, the Homes of the British Aristocracy in the
Camera: being Reminiscences of a Peripatetic Photographer,&quot; therefore, contained
no view of Bissett Grange; which was to be regretted, as neither The Hassocks,
the Rector's residence, nor The Radishes, the seat of Sir Hipson Hawes, the lord
of the manor, both of which figured extensively in the photographic publication,
was to be compared with Marmaduke Wentworth's ancestral mansion. The elm-avenue
extended from the lodge to the house,--nearly half a mile,--and through the
trees you saw the broad expanse of the park, covered with that beautiful soft
turf which is in the highest perfection in Sussex, and which afforded pasture
for hundreds of dappled deer, who would raise their heads at the sound of
approaching footsteps or carriage-wheels, and, after peering forward earnestly
with outstretched necks at the intrusion, would wheel round and start off at a
peculiar sling trot, gradually merging into the most graceful of gallops.</p>
<p>Immediately in front of the porch, and only divided from it by the
carriage-sweep, was an enormous flower-bed, sloping towards the sides, and
culminating in the centre,--the pride of the head-gardener's soul. Right and
left of the house were two arches, exactly alike. Passing through that to the
left, you came upon the stables and coach-houses, of which there is little to be
said, save that they were old-fashioned, and what the helpers called
&quot;ill-conwenient;&quot; and that the fine London grooms who came down with their
master's hacks and carriage-horses in the autumn--Sir Marmaduke was never at
Bissett during the hunting season--used to curse them freely as a set of
tumbledown old sheds, fit only for jobs and fly-'osses. And yet the old
quadrangle, environed by the stable-buildings, with their red-tiled roofs and
their slate-coloured half-hatch doors, each duly bearing its horse-shoe and its
hecatomb of mouse and stoat skeletons, was picturesque, more especially of an
evening, when the setting sun gleamed on the quaint old clock-turret,
ivy-covered and swallow-haunted, and steeped in a rich crimson glow the pretty
cottage of old Martin, erst head-groom, now a superannuated pensioner Martin,
who was never so happy as when babbling of bygone days, and who &quot;minded the
time&quot; when the stables were full of blood horses, and when Master Marmaduke (the
present proprietor) rode Saucy Sally over all the raspers in the county.</p>
<p>Through the other arch you came upon the gardens of the Grange. Immediately
before you lay a broad expanse of lawn,--such smooth, soft turf as is only met
with in England, and only there in well-to-do places. Short, crisp, and velvety
was the grass, kept with the greatest care, and rolled and mown with the most
undeviating punctuality; for Sir Marmaduke was proud of his lawn, and liked to
sit out there in his high-backed rustic seat on the hot August evenings,
placidly smoking his cigar, and occasionally raising his head to be fanned by
the soft sea-breeze which came blowing over the neighbouring downs. He would as
soon have thought of allowing a servant to take a liberty with him as of
permitting any one to drive a croquet-iron into that lawn, or to attempt to play
any game on it. Between the house and the lawn ran a broad gravelled walk,
passing down which you came upon the orchard and upon the fig-garden, which was
the glory of the county, and was enclosed with an old red-brick wall, which
itself looked ripe and ruddy. To the right lay the kitchen-garden,--a fertile
slope of land in the highest state of cultivation, dotted every here and there
with huge lights and frames, and spread nets, and overgrown cucumbers, and
bursting marrows; for though Sir Marmaduke cared but little for flowers, he was
a great fruit-grower, and, next to seeing his pines and melons on his own table
(where, glowing on the old ancestral Wentworth plate, they looked like a study
for Lance), his great gratification was to bear away with them the prizes from
the Horticultural Shows in the neighbourhood. Beyond the orchard was a large
field, known as the Paddock, whither thee croquet-players and the archers were
relegated, and where the turf was almost as smooth as that of the sacred lawn
itself. Over all,--house, lawn, orchard, kitchen-garden, and paddock, and far
away across the surrounding downs--there was a delicious sense of calm and
quiet; a feeling which was heightened rather than lessened by the inhabitants of
a rookery established in the tall elm-trees bordering the Paddock, and who, as
they sailed over the grounds of the Grange, would express their approbation by
one single solemn caw.</p>
<p>The house faced the avenue, and was a queer, odd, square block, by no means
picturesque, but quaintly ugly something like an old-fashioned child, whose
decidedly curious features, out of all drawing and impossible to be admired, yet
have something humorously lovable in their expression. A staring red-brick house
of Queen Anne's time, that ought to have been formal, and perhaps had been at
some period or other, but which had undergone so many changes--had had so many
gables put on here, and windows let in there, and rooms added on wherever they
were wanted--as to lose all trace of its original design, and to have become of
a composite style of architecture which would have driven Mr. Ruskin mad. It was
the only gentleman's seat for miles round which was built of red brick, and not
that gray stone which always looks weather-beaten and time-worn; instead of
which, the Grange had a jolly, cheery, comic expression, and when the sun
gleamed on its little diamond-shaped, leaden-casemented windows, they seemed to
twinkle like the eyes of a genial red-faced old gentleman at some good joke or
pleasant dish. A comfortable old house in every sense of the word, with an
enormous number of rooms, large airy spacious chambers, queer little nooks and
snuggeries, long passages with pannelled partitions dividing them from other
passages, partitions with occasional square windows or round eyelet-holes cut in
them, wide straggling staircases with broad steps and broad balustrades, which
no boy had ever yet been known to pass without sliding down them on his stomach.
A couple of queer turreted chambers, like the place where the yard-measure lives
in old-fashioned work-boxes, and a set of attics, low-roofed, and rather
worm-eaten and mouldy-smelling. These were not inhabited, for the servants had
their own quarters in the western wing; a bit of eccentric building, which had
been thrown out long after the original structure, and gave to the old mansion,
from the back view, a comical lopsided appearance; and when the rest of the
house was filled, the bachelors were sent to what was known as the Barracks, or
the Kennel, a series of jolly little rooms shut out from the respectable portion
of the building by a long passage, where they kept up their own fun till a very
late hour of the night, where there was always an overhanging smell of tobacco,
and whence, in the early mornings, there came such a roaring and clanging of
shower-baths, and such a sound of hissing and sluicing and splashing, that you
might have fancied yourself in the vicinity of an army of Tritons.</p>
<p>Two o'clock on a hot afternoon at the end of September; and, with the
exception of a few sportsmen, who are now reclining under a high hedge and
lighting pipes, after a succulent repast of game-pie, cold partridge, and bitter
beer, all the party at the Grange is assembled round the luncheon-table in the
dining-room. That is Marmaduke Wentworth, the tall old man standing on the
hearthrug, with his back towards the empty fire-grate. His head is perfectly
bald and shining, and has but a fringe of crisp white hair; his features are
what is called &quot;aristocratic,&quot; well-shaped, and comely; his eyes are cold,
clear, gray; his lips slightly full, and his teeth sound and regular. He is in
his invariable morning dress,--a blue coat with brass buttons, a buff waistcoat,
and gray trousers with gaping dog's-eared pockets, into which his hands are
always plunged. Looking at him now, you would scarcely recognise the <i>roué</i>
of George the Fourth's time, the Poins to the wild Prince, the hero of a hundred
intrigues and escapades. In heat and turmoil, in drinking, dicing, and dancing,
Marmaduke Wentworth passed his early youth; and from this debauchery he was
rescued by the single passion of his life. The object of that passion--his
cousin, a lovely girl, whose innocence won the dissipated roisterer from his
evil ways, and gave him new notions and new hopes--died within three months of
their engagement; and from that day Wentworth became another man. He went
abroad, and for ten years led a solitary studious life; returning to England, he
brought with him his bookworm tastes; and it was long before he emerged from the
seclusion of Bissett Grange, which he had inherited, and returned once more to
London life. Even then, he sought his society in a very different set to that in
which he had previously shone. George the Great was dead; sailor King William
had followed him to the grave; and the new men fluttering round the court of the
new Queen, setting fashions and issuing social ordinances, had been cradled
children when Marmaduke Wentworth had copied Brummel's cravats, or listened to
Alvanley's <i>bons mots</i>. Even had he continued a &quot;dandy,&quot; he would have been
displeased with the &quot;swells&quot; to whom the dandies had given place; and now,
changed as he was into a disappointed elderly gentleman, with a bitter tongue
and an intolerant spirit, his unsocial cynicism bored the new men, while their
slangy flippancy disgusted him. So, in the phrase of the day, he &quot;went in for a
new excitement;&quot; and, though his name and his appearance were as well known in
London as those of the Duke of Wellington, there were but few people of his own
status or time of life who were retained on an intimate footing. Some few old
friends, who themselves had suffered heart-shipwreck, or seen their argosies of
early feelings go down in sight of port, claimed companionship with the
querulous, crotchety companion of their youth, and had their claims allowed. His
odd, quaint savagery, his utter contempt for the recognised laws of politeness,
his free speaking, and his general eccentricity, had a great charm for young
people of both sexes; and if they had any thing in them to elevate them above
the ordinary run of yea-and-nay young persons, they invariably found their
advances responded to. Then there was a great attraction for young people in the
society which they met at one of Marmaduke's dinners--men whose names were
before the world; an occasional cabinet-minister sweetening the severities of
office with a little pleasant relaxation in company where he might take the mask
from his face and the gag from his mouth; authors of note; rising artists;
occasionally an actor or two,--all these were to be found round Wentworth's
table. The old gentleman was in London from January to July. During that time he
gave four dinner-parties a week (one of them, I regret to say, and generally the
pleasantest, on a Sunday), and during the other three days dined out. He was a
member of the True-Blue and the Minerva Clubs, but seldom went to either; he was
admissible by the hall-porter of every theatre in London, and sometimes strayed
behind the scenes and took possession of the green-room hearthrug, whence he
vented remarkably free and discriminating criticisms on the actors and actresses
surrounding him. He had one special butt, an old German baron of fabulous age,
who was supposed to have been a page to Frederick the Great, who had been for
thirty years in England, and had only acquired the very smallest knowledge of
its language, and whose power of placidly enduring savage attacks was only
equalled by the vigour of his appetite. The Baron was never brought down to
Bissett; but, as we have heard from Gumble, was sent off to some seaside place
to recruit his digestion; whence he invariably turned up again in Curzon Street
in January, with the same wig, the same dyed beard, the same broken English, and
an appetite, if any thing, improved by his marine sojourn.</p>
<p>There is a strange medley now collected at the Grange. That tall girl, seated
at the far end of the table, with her chin leaning on her hand, is Barbara
Lexden. Three years ago, when, at nineteen, she was presented, she created a <i>
furore</i>; and even now, though her first freshness is gone, she is even more
beautiful--has rounded and ripened, and holds her own with the best in town.
More <i>distingué</i>--looking than beautiful, though, is Barbara. Het face is a
little too long for perfect oval; her nose is very slightly aquiline, with
delicately curved, thin, transparent nostrils; her forehead marked with two deep
lines, from a curious trick of elevating her eyebrows when surprised, and shaded
with broad thick masses of dark-brown hair, bound tightly round her head, taken
off behind her ears,--small, and glistening like pink shells,--and terminating
in a thick plaited clump; sleepy, greenish-gray eyes, with long drooping lashes;
a tall, undulating, pear-shaped figure, always seen to best advantage in a
tight-fitting dress, with a neat little collar and nun-like simple linen cuffs;
a swimming walk; feet and ankles beyond compare; and hands--ah, such hands!--not
plump, slender, with long fingers, and rosy filbert nails; such hands as Ninon
de l'Enclos might have had, but such as, save on Barbara, I have only seen in
wax, on black velvet, under a glass case, modelled from Lady Blessington's, and
purchased at the Gore-House Sale. Blue was her favourite colour, violet her
favourite perfume, admiration the longing of her soul. She was never happy until
every one with whom she was brought into contact had given in their submission
to her. No matter of what age or in what condition of life, all must bow. Once,
during a Commemoration Week at Oxford, she completely turned various hoary heads
of houses, and caused the wife of an eminent Church dignitary, after thirty
years of happy marriage, to bedew her pillow with tears of bitter jealousy at
seeing how completely the courteous old dean was fascinated by the lovely
visitor; and she would laugh with saucy triumph as she heard the blunt,
outspoken admiration of working-men as she sat well forward in the carriage
blocked up in St. James's Street on a Drawing-room day, or slowly creeping along
the line of vehicles which were &quot;setting down&quot; at the Horticultural-Gardens
gates.</p>
<p>With the exception of flirtation, in which she would have taken the highest
honours, her accomplishments were neither more nor less than those of most women
of her position. She played brilliantly, with a firm, dashing touch, and sang,
perhaps not artistically, but with an amount of feeling thrown into her deep
contralto that did frightful execution; her French was very good; her German
passable, grammatical, and well phrased, but lacking the real rough accent and
guttural smack. At all events, she had made the most of what schooling she had
had, for it was desultory enough. Her father, the youngest son of a good family,
ran away with the black-eyed, ruddy-cheeked daughter of the Herefordshire parson
with whom he went to read during the Long Vacation; was immediately disinherited
by his father; left the University, and by the influence of his family got into
a Government office; where, by his own exertions, he got into bad company, into
debt, and into prison. On his deathbed he commended his wife and daughter to the
care of his elder sister, who had never married, but lived very comfortably on
the property which ought to have been his. Miss Lexden came once to see her
brother's widow and orphan in the lodgings which they had taken in Lambeth to be
near the King's Bench Prison. But years of trouble had not changed the poor
mother for the better, and her stately sister-in-law regarded her with horror.
In truth, the colour had faded from her rosy cheeks, and the light died out of
her black eyes long ago, and had left her a dowdy, silly, fussy little woman,
with nothing to say. So Miss Lexden thought she could best fulfil her brother's
charge with least trouble to herself by allowing the bereaved ones fifty pounds
a year; and on this, and what she could make by working for the Berlin-wool and
fancy-stationery shops, the widow supported herself and her child for some
twelve years, when she died. Miss Lexden then took the child to the dull,
stately old house in Gloucester Place, Portman Square; where, with the aid of a
toady, the daily visit of a smug physician, an airing in a roomy old carriage
drawn by a couple of fat horses, a great deal of good eating and drinking, and a
tolerable amount of society, she managed to lead a jolly godless old life. She
found her niece, then fourteen years old, less ignorant and more presentable
than she had imagined; for Barbara had received from her mother a sound English
education, and had, on the pea-and-pigeon principle, picked lip a little French
and the rudiments of music. She looked and moved like a lady, and moreover had
an insolence of manner, a <i>de haut en bas</i> treatment of nearly every body,
which the old lady hailed as a true Lexden characteristic, and rejoiced over
greatly. So Barbara was sent to Paris for three years, and came back at
seventeen finished in education, ripened in beauty, and a thorough coquette at
heart. Of course she had already had several <i>affaires</i>: several with the
professors attached to the Champs-Elysées <i>pension</i>; one with an Italian
count, who bribed the ladies'-maid to convey notes, and who was subsequently
thrashed and instructed in the <i>savate</i> by the Auvergnat porter of the
establishment; and one with an English gentleman coming over from Boulogne; and
her aunt used to encourage her to tell of these, and would laugh at them until
the tears came into her eyes.</p>
<p>At nineteen she was presented, made her <i>coup</i>, and now for two seasons
had been a reigning belle. Offers she had had in plenty,--youthful peers with
slender incomes; middle-aged commoners, solemn, wealthy, and dull; smug
widowers, hoping to renew the sweets of matrimony, and trusting to bygone
experience to keep clear of its bitters. But Barbara refused them all; played
with them, landed them,--giving them all the time the most pleasurable
sensations of encouragement, as old Izaak used to tickle trout,--and then flung
them back, bruised and gasping, into that muddy stream the world. She told her
aunt she was playing for a high stake; that she did not care for any of these
men; that she did not think she ever should care for any one; under which
circumstances she had better make the best bargain of herself, and go at a high
price. There are plenty of women like this. We rave against cruel parents and
sordid Mammon-matches; but very often the parents are merely passive in the
matter. There are plenty of girls who have walnuts, or peach stones, or
something equally impressible, where their hearts should be, who have never
experienced the smallest glimmer of love, and who look upon the possession of a
carriage and an Opera-box, and admission into high society, as the acme of human
enjoyment.</p>
<p>Sitting next to Barbara is Fred Lyster, a slim, dark man, with small regular
features and a splendid flowing black beard. He was educated at Addiscombe, and
was out in India under Gough and Outram; did good service, was highly thought
of, and was thoroughly happy; when his old godfather died, and left him heir to
a property of three thousand a year. He returned at once to England, and became
the most idle, purposeless, dreamiest of men. He had tried every thing, and
found it all hollow. He had travelled on the Continent, been on the turf,
gambled in stocks and railways, kept a yacht, and was bored by each and all. He
had thought of going into Parliament, and went for two nights into the Speaker's
Gallery; but did not pursue the idea, because he found that &quot;the fellows talked
so much.&quot; His plaintive moans against life were sources of intense amusement to
his friends; and when he discovered this--which he did at once, being a very
long way from a fool--he was not in the least annoyed, but rather lent himself
to the idea, and heightened his expressions of <i>ennui</i> and despondency. He
liked to be with Sir Marmaduke; for the old gentleman's brusque manners and
general intolerance afforded him real amusement, and he laid himself open to
attack by always being more than ever drawling and inane when in his company.
The baronet, who had a quick perception of character, knew Lyster's real worth,
and often talked to him seriously about having some purpose in life; and when he
only got vague and dreamy replies, he would burst out into a torrent of
invective, in the middle of which Lyster would run, shrieking with laughter,
from the room.</p>
<p>Next to Captain Lyster sits Miss Lexden, Barbara's aunt; a fat,
placid-looking old lady, in a flaxen front, which, with a cap covered with
ribbons and flowers, seemed skewered on to her skull by a couple of large pins,
the knobs of which presented themselves like bosses on her temples. She was a
cousin of Sir Marmaduke's, and the elder sister of the old man's one love, so
that there was a great link of confidence between them; and she liked coming to
Bissett, where the living was always so good, and where she met people who
amused her. That pretty girl talking to her is Miss Townshend,--a delicious
creature in a country-house, who can ride across country, and play croquet and
billiards, and sing little French <i>chansons</i>, and dance, and who even has
been known on occasions to drive a dog-cart and smoke a cigarette. To secure
her, entails inviting her father, an intensely respectable, dreary old
gentleman--that is he, in the starched check cravat and the high coat-collar; a
City magnate, who confines his reading to the City article, and has to be
promptly extinguished when he attempts to talk about the &quot;policy of Rooshia.&quot; He
is endeavouring just now to strike up a conversation with his neighbour Mr.
Vincent, the member for Wessex, and Chairman of the Dinner-Committee of the
House of Commons; but Mr. Vincent is deep in the discussion of a
cheese-omelette, and is telegraphing recommendation thereof to Mrs. Vincent, a
merry, red-faced looking little woman, who, with her husband, passed her whole
life in thinking about good eating. Sir Marmaduke's solicitor, Mr. Russell, a
quiet old gentleman, clad in professional black, who was always trying to hide
his soft wrinkled hands under his ample coat-cuffs; and Sir Marmaduke's
factotum, Major Stone, otherwise Twenty Stone, a big, broad-chested, jovial,
bushy-whiskered, moneyless freelance,--completed the party.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_03" href="#div1Ref_03">CHAPTER III.</a></h4>
<h5>STARTING THE GAME.</h5>
<br>
<p>&quot;Halloa!&quot; suddenly shouted Sir Marmaduke from his vantage-ground on the rug.</p>
<p>Every body looked up.</p>
<p>&quot;Halloo!&quot; shouted the old gentleman again, plunging his hands over the wrists
in his trousers-pockets, and bringing to the surface a couple of letters. &quot;By
Jove! I forgot to tell Mrs. Mason or any of them that more people were coming
down! Here, Stone--somebody--just ring that bell, will you? Here are two men
coming down to-day--be here by dinner, they say; and I forgot to order rooms and
things for them!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who are they, Sir Marmaduke?&quot; asked Lyster languidly.</p>
<p>&quot;What the deuce is that to you, sir?&quot; roared the old gentleman. &quot;Friends of
mine, sir! That's enough, isn't it? Have you finished lunch.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I haven't had any,&quot; said Lyster. &quot;I never eat it. I hate lunch.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Great mistake that,&quot; said Mr. Vincent, wiping his mouth. &quot;Ought always to
eat whenever you can. 'Gad, for such an omelette as that I'd get up in the
middle of the night.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps, Lyster,&quot; said Major Stone, coming back from ringing the bell,
&quot;you're of the opinion of the man who said that lunch was an insult to your
breakfast and an injury to your dinner?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He was a confounded fool, whoever he was,&quot; broke in Sir Marmaduke. &quot;I hate
those fellows who talk epigrams. Halloa, Gumble, is that you? Tell Mrs. Mason
two gentlemen are coming down to stop. She must get rooms ready for them, and
that sort of thing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Sir Marmaduke,&quot; said Gumble. &quot;In the Barracks, Sir Marmaduke?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;God bless my soul, sir! how should I know?&quot; said his master testily. &quot;What
do I keep a housekeeper for, and a pack of lazy servants, who do nothing but
eat, if I'm to be worried about things like this? Tell Mrs. Mason, sir! Do as
you're told!&quot;</p>
<p>And exit Gumble, whose admirable training and long experience only prevented
him from bursting into a guffaw.</p>
<p>&quot;Though you refused Captain Lyster, I don't think you'll mind telling me who
these gentlemen are, Sir Marmaduke?&quot; said Barbara, leaving the table, and
advancing to the rug.</p>
<p>&quot;No, my dear; I'll tell you any thing. Besides, they'll be here to-night. One
is Mr. Beresford, and the other a learned professor. There, I've thrown them
among you to worry their reputations before they arrive; and now I'll be off to
my study. And don't any of you come and bother me; do you hear? If you want any
thing, ask Stone for it. Come, Russell.&quot;</p>
<p>And, followed by the lawyer, the old gentleman left the room, after patting
Barbara's head with one hand, and shaking his clenched fist, in a serio-comic
manner, at the rest of the company.</p>
<p>&quot;What very strange people my cousin does get hold of!&quot; said Miss Lexden,
commencing the onslaught directly the door was closed. &quot;Which Mr. Beresford is
it, do you suppose?&quot;</p>
<p>The question was general, but Mr. Townshend answered it, by saying pompously,</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps it's Mr. Beresford, one of the Directors of the Bank of England,
who--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;God forbid!&quot; broke in Lyster, suddenly.</p>
<p>&quot;Amen to that sweet prayer,&quot; said Barbara, in a low voice. Then louder: &quot;Oh,
dear, let's hope it's not an old gentleman from the City.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, no; don't fear,&quot; said Major Stone, laughing. &quot;You all know him. It's
Charley Beresford, from the Tin-Tax Office.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What! the Commissioner?&quot; exclaimed little Miss Townshend, clapping her
hands. &quot;Oh, I <i>am</i> so glad! He is <i>such</i> fun!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, every body knows Mr. Beresford,&quot; said Vincent; &quot;capital judge of
cooking; on the committee of the Beauclerk.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm afraid I'm nobody, then,&quot; said old Miss Lexden; &quot;what age is he?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, same age as every body else,&quot; drawled Lyster. &quot;I find every body's the
same age,--seven-and-twenty. Nobody ever goes beyond that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You know Mr. Beresford, aunt,&quot; said Barbara. &quot;He's a favourite horror of
yours. You recollect him at Hawley last year?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, the odious man who carried on so shamefully with that rich woman,--the
grocer's widow!&quot; said the old lady. &quot;Well, wasn't it a grocer?--merchant, then,
if you like,--something to do with the City and the West Indies, I know. Oh, a
dreadful person!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Charley Beresford's not a bad fellow, though,&quot; said Lyster. &quot;Who did Sir
Marmaduke say the other man was? Professor something.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps Major Stone knows him,&quot; chimed in Mrs. Townshend.</p>
<p>&quot;Who's the Professor that's coming down, Stone?&quot; asked Lyster.</p>
<p>&quot;I <i>don't</i> know. I only know two professors: Jackman the
conjuror,--Jacquinto he calls himself,--and Holloway the ointment-man; and it's
neither of them. This is some scientific or literary great gun that Sir
Marmaduke was introduced to lately.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, dear!&quot; said Barbara, plaintively, &quot;what a dreadful idea! Probably an old
gentleman, with gold spectacles and a bald head, covered all over with the dust
of the British Museum, and carrying dead beetles and things in his pockets!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A professor!&quot; said Miss Townshend; &quot;we had one at Gimp House--a French one!
I'm sure he'll take snuff and have silk pocket-handkerchiefs.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And choke at his meals,&quot; added Barbara. &quot;This is too horrible.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I trust he won't come from any low neighbourhood,&quot; said Mrs. Vincent; &quot;the
small-pox is very bad in some districts in London.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The deuce! I hope he won't bring it down here,&quot; drawled Lyster.</p>
<p>&quot;There's not the slightest fear of infection, if you've been vaccinated,&quot;
said Mr. Townshend.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, but I haven't,&quot; replied Lyster. &quot;I wouldn't be--at least without
chloroform; it hurts one so.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What nonsense, Captain Lyster!&quot; laughed Barbara. &quot;Why, I was vaccinated, and
it didn't hurt me the least.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did it hurt as much as sitting for your photograph?&quot; asked the Captain,
rising. &quot;Because I'll never sit for my photograph again, except under
chloroform.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, small-pox or not, you'll see the old gentleman at dinner,&quot; said Stone;
&quot;and you mustn't chaff him, mind, Lyster; for he's a favourite of Sir
Marmaduke's.&quot;</p>
<p>And so the luncheon-party broke up. Old Miss Lexden and Miss Townshend drove
out in a pony-phaeton, with the intention of falling in with the shooting party;
Mrs. Vincent retired to her room, to allow the process of digestion to take
place during her afternoon nap; Mr. Vincent walked leisurely across the fields
to the neighbouring village, and had an interview with a fisherman's wife, who
had a new method of dressing mackerel; Mr. Townshend took out a pamphlet on the
Bank Charter, and, having placed it before him, went straight off to sleep;
Major Stone mounted his sure-footed cob and rode round the farm, looking after
broken fences, and dropping hints as to the expediency of all being ready with
the Michaelmas rent; and Barbara and Captain Lyster wandered into the Paddock,
with the intention of playing croquet.</p>
<p>But they had played only very few strokes, when Lyster, leaning on his
mallet, looked across at his companion, and said gravely,</p>
<p>&quot;I assure you, Miss Lexden, I pity you from the bottom of my soul.&quot;</p>
<p>As she stood there, her complexion heightened by the exercise, the little
round hat admirably suiting the classic shape of her head, and the neatest
little foot tapping the mallet, she didn't look much to be pitied; and she
tossed her head rather disdainfully, as she asked,</p>
<p>&quot;Pity me, Captain Lyster! and why?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because you are so horribly bored here! I've been such a terrible sufferer
from <i>ennui</i> myself, that I know every expression on those who have it; and
you're very far advanced indeed. <i>I</i> know what it is that beats you, and I
can't help you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And what is it, pray?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You know what Cleopatra says in the <i>Dream of Fair Women</i>: 'I have no
men to govern in this wood!' Pardon me; I'm a singular person; not clever, you
know, but always saying what I think, and that sort of thing; and you're dying
for a flirtation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Surely <i>you</i> have no cause to complain. I've never tried to make you my
'Hercules, my Roman Antony,' Captain Lyster.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No; you've been good enough to spare me. You've known me too long, and think
of me, rightly enough perhaps, as the 'dull, cold-blooded Cæsar;' and there's no
one here that's at all available except Stone, and his berth with Sir Marmaduke
is like a college-fellowship--he'd have to resign all income if he married. It's
an awful position for you! Oh, by Jove, I forgot the two men coming! I'm afraid
Charley Beresford's no go; but you might make great running with the Professor.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<i>Que d'honneur!</i>&quot; said Barbara, laughing at his serious face. &quot;That is
a compliment, especially after our notions of what he will be like;&quot; and then,
after a minute's reflection, she added, with a proud gesture, &quot;It would be a new
field, at all events, and not a bad triumph, to win a steady sage from his books
and--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Vivien over again, by Jove!&quot; said Lyster, in the nearest approach he had
ever made to a shout; &quot;Vivien divested of all impropriety; only look out that
Merlin does not get you into the charm. They've no end of talk, these clever
fellows. I knew a professor at Addiscombe--deuced ugly bird too--who ran off
with an earl's daughter, all through his gab--I beg pardon, his tongue.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<i>Gare aux corbeaux!</i> I flatter myself I can hold my own with the old
crows,&quot; said Barbara; &quot;however, this is mere nonsense. No more croquet, thank
you, Captain Lyster. I must go in and reflect on your words of wisdom.&quot;</p>
<p>And dropping him a little curtsey of mock humility, she moved off towards the
house.</p>
<p>&quot;I'd lay long odds she follows up the idea,&quot; said Lyster to himself, as he
sat down on the twisted roots of an old elm and lit a cheroot. &quot;She's a fine
creature,&quot; he added, looking after her; &quot;something in the Cheetah line,--fine
and swervy and supple, and as clever as--as old boots. How awfully old I'm
growing! I should have gone mad after such a girl as that once; and now--she
doesn't cause me the slightest emotion. There's that little Townshend, now,--ah,
that's quite another matter!&quot;</p>
<p>Had Barbara really any notion of following out Lyster's sportive notion, and
of playing Vivien to an aged Merlin? of winning from his goddess Study a man
whose whole life had been passed at her shrine, and of lighting with as much
fire as yet remained to him eyes dimmed with midnight researches? I know not.
But I do know that she spent more time that evening over her toilet than she had
done during her stay at the Grange, and that she never looked lovelier than in
her rich blue dinner-dress, trimmed with black lace, and with a piece of velvet
passing through her hair, and coquettishly fastened at one side by a single
splendid turquoise. Perhaps some thought of her conversation with Lyster flitted
across her brain; for she smiled saucily as she stepped down the wide old
staircase, and she had hardly composed her countenance by the time she had
passed into the drawing-room, where the party was assembled. The room was
lighted only by the flickering blaze of a wood-fire (for the evenings were
already chilly), and she could only indistinctly make out that the gentleman
whom Sir Marmaduke introduced as &quot;Professor Churchill,&quot; and who was to take her
in to dinner, was tall, had no spectacles, and was apparently not so old as she
had anticipated. But when she looked at him in the full light of the
dining-room, she nearly uttered an exclamation of surprise when she saw, as the
embodiment of her intended Merlin, a man of six feet in height, about thirty
years of age, with short wavy brown hair, hazel eyes, a crisp dark beard, and a
genial, good-humoured, sensible expression. All this she took in in covert
glances; and so astonished was she, that after a few commonplaces she could not
resist saying,</p>
<p>&quot;And are you really a professor, Mr. Churchill?&quot;</p>
<p>He laughed heartily--a clear, ringing, jolly laugh--as he replied, &quot;Well, I
am,--at least I stand so honoured on the books of old Leipzig University, and
our good host here always will insist on dubbing me with my full title. But I
don't generally sport it. I always think of dancing, or calisthenics, or
deportment,--Turveydrop, you know,--in connexion with the professorship. I can't
help noticing that you look astonished, Miss Lexden; I trust I haven't rudely
put to flight any preconceived notions of yours as to my dignity?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No--at least--well, I will frankly own my notions were different.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There, you see, I had the advantage; with the exception of flatly
contradicting the late Mr. Campbell in his assertion about distance lending
enchantment, &amp;c., my ideas of you are thoroughly realised. But--I had seen you
before.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You had!&quot; said Barbara, feeling a pleasurable glow pass over her cheek at
something in his tone.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, yes; several times. The first time ten years ago, when I saw you in
company with your father--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My father! Where?&quot; interrupted Barbara.</p>
<p>&quot;Where? oh, at an hotel,--Burdon's Hotel. You won't remember it, of course.&quot;
(Barbara never knew why Major Stone, who was sitting near them, grinned broadly
when Mr. Churchill said this.) &quot;You were a little child then. And recently I
have seen you at the Opera, and ridden past you in the Row.&quot;</p>
<p>At this juncture Sir Marmaduke called out to Churchill from the other end of
the table, and the conversation became general. Barbara watched Mr. Churchill as
he took a leading part in it, his earnest face lit up, and all listening
attentively to his remarks. What a clever, sensible face it was! And he went to
the Opera, and rode in the Park! What about Vivien and Merlin now?</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_04" href="#div1Ref_04">CHAPTER IV.</a></h4>
<h5>THE COMMISSIONER'S VIEWS ARE MATRIMONIAL.</h5>
<br>
<p>Mr. Charles Beresford, Junior Commissioner of the Tin-Tax Office, who was
expected down at Bissett, did not leave London, as he had intended, on the day
which witnessed Mr. Churchill's arrival at that hospitable mansion. His
portmanteau and gun-case had been taken by his servant to the Club, where he was
to call for them on his way to the station; and he had arranged with one of his
brother-commissioners to undertake his work of placing his initials in the
corner of various documents submitted to him. He had stayed in town longer than
his wont; and as he looked out into the dreary quadrangle of Rutland House, in a
block of which the Tin-Tax Office was situate, and gazed upon the blazing flags,
and the dull <i>commissionnaires</i> sitting on their bench outside the
principal entrance and winking in the heat, and upon the open windows
opposite,--whereat two clerks were concocting an effervescent drink in a
tumbler, and stirring it round with a paper-knife,--he cursed the dulness, and
expressed his delight that he was about to rusticate for a lengthened period.</p>
<p>Nobody heard this speech; or if indeed, the words fell upon the ear of the
soft-shod messenger who at that moment entered the room, he was far too
dexterous and too old an official to let his face betray it. He glided softly to
Mr. Beresford's elbow, as that gentleman still remained at the window, vacantly
watching the powder-mixing clerks, and murmured,</p>
<p>&quot;Letter, sir.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Put it down,&quot; aid Beresford, without turning round. &quot;Official, eh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, sir, private. Brought just now by a groom. No answer, sir.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Give it here,&quot; said Beresford, stretching out his hand. &quot;Ah, no answer!
That'll do, Stubbs.&quot;</p>
<p>And Stubbs went his way to a glass-case, in which, in the company of four
other messengers and twenty bells, his official days were passed, and gave
himself up to bemoaning his stupidity in having taken his fortnight's leave of
absence in the past wet July instead of the present sultry season.</p>
<p>Mr. Beresford looked at the address of the letter, and frowned slightly. It
was a small note, pink paper, with a couchant dog and an utterly illegible
monogram on the seal, and the superscription was written in a long scrawly hand.
There was an odour of patchouli, too, about it which roused Beresford's ire, and
he muttered as he opened it, &quot;Confounded stuff! Who on earth is she copying now,
with her scents and crests and humbug? I thought she'd more sense than that!&quot;
And he ran his eye over the note. It was very short.</p>
<p>&quot;Dear Charley,--What has become of you? Why do you never come near The Den?
It is nearly three weeks since you were here. I'm off to Scarborough on Tuesday;
a lot of my pupils are there and want me, so I can carry on my little game of
money-making, get some fresh air, and perhaps pick up some fresh nags to sell
before the hunting season, all 'under vun hat,' as Tom Orme fasechous--facesh (I
don't know how to spell it)--says. Come up and dine to-night at seven. There are
two or three good fellows coming, and I want to talk to you and to look at your
old phiz again, and see how much older you've grown during your absence, and how
much <i>balder</i>; for, you know, you're growing <i>bald</i>, Charley, and that
will be awful hard lines to such a <i>swell</i> as you. Seven sharp, mind.</p>
<p>&quot;Always yours,</p>
<p>&quot;K. M.</p>
<p>&quot;P.S. Charley, if you don't come, I shall think you've grown <i>proud</i>;
and it'll be a great shame, and I shall never speak to you again.</p>
<p>&quot;K.M.&quot;</p>
<p>Now lest, after a perusal of this letter, any one should think ill of its
writer, I take leave to announce at once that Kate Mellon was a virtuous woman;
pure in heart, though any thing but simple; without fear, but not without as
much reproach as could possibly be heaped upon her by all of her own sex who
envied her good looks, her high spirits, and her success. There are, I take it,
plenty of novels in which one can read the doings, either openly described or
broadly hinted at, of the daughters of Shame under many a pretty alias; and it
is because one of these aliases describes the calling of which Kate Mellon was
the most successful follower, that I am so desirous of clearing her good name,
and immediately vindicating her position with my readers. Kate Mellon was a
horsebreaker, a <i>bonâ-fide</i> horsebreaker; one who curbed colts, and &quot;took
it out of&quot; kickers and rearers, and taught wild Irish horses and four-year-olds
fresh from Yorkshire spinneys to curvet and caper prettily in the Park. She
taught riding, too; and half the Amazons in the Row owed their tightness of seat
and lightness of hand to her judicious training. She hunted occasionally with
the Queen's hounds and with the Pytchley, and no one rode straighter or with
more <i>nonchalance</i> than she. Give her a lead, that was all she wanted; and
when she got it, as she invariably did from the boldest horseman in the field,
she would settle herself in her saddle, left hand well down, right hand jauntily
on her hip, and fly over timber, water, no matter what, like a bird. In social
life her great pride was that there &quot;was no nonsense&quot; about her; she was not
more civil to the great ladies who sent their horses to her establishment to be
broke, and who would occasionally come up and inspect the process, than she was
to the stable-helpers' wives and children, who all worshipped her for her
openhanded generosity. Tommy Orme who was popularly supposed to be a hundred and
fifty years old, but who lived with the youth of the Household Brigade and the
Foreign Office and the <i>coryphées</i>, and who knew every body remarkable in
any one way, never was tired of telling how Kate, teaching the Dowager Lady
Wylminster to drive a pair of spirited dun ponies, had, in the grand lady's
idea, intrenched upon her prerogative, and was told that she was a presuming
person, and desired to remember her place.</p>
<p>&quot;Person, indeed!&quot; said Kate; &quot;person yourself, ma'am! My place isn't by you
after that, and now get the duns home the best way you can;&quot; with which she
sprang from the low phaeton, struck off across the fields, and left the wretched
representative of aristocracy &quot;with a couple of plunging brutes that soon spilt
the old woman into the hedge, broke the trap all to pieces, and rushed away home
with the splinter-bar at their heels--give you my word!&quot; as Tommy used to
narrate it.</p>
<p>Her manner with men was perfectly frank and open, equally devoid of reticence
or coquetry. She called them all by their Christian names if they were
commoners, by their titles if they were lords. She answered at once when
addressed as &quot;Kitty,&quot; or &quot;Old Lady,&quot; or &quot;Stunner;&quot; by all of which appellations
she was known. She would lay her whip lightly across the shoulders of any
particular friend as a token of recognition at the meet; would smoke a cigarette
on her way home after the kill; and always carried sherry and sandwiches in a
silver combination of flask and box. Her grammar was shaky, and her aspirate
occasionally misplaced; she never read any thing but <i>Bell's Life</i> and
books on farriery, and she laughed a loud, ringing, resonant shout; but her
speech was always free from bad words, and no man ever tried a <i>double
entendre</i> or a blasphemy twice in her presence. Living the odd strange life
she did, defiant of all society's prejudices, it was yet strange that even
London slander had left her unassailed. They did say that she was very much
taken by Bob Mayo's sabre-scar when he returned from the Crimea, and that
Barker, the steeple-chase rider, half gentleman, half jock, was engaged to her;
but nothing came of either of these two reports. Early in her London career,
very soon after she came to town, and when men were first beginning to inquire
who was the dashing horsewoman who rode such splendid cattle with such pluck and
skill, De Blague, the Queen's messenger, assumed to know all about her, and at
Limmer's, one night, threw out certain hints by no means uncomplimentary to
himself, and eked out with many nods and winks; but two days after that, as De
Blague, with two other Foreign-Office men, was leaning over the rails in the
Row, Miss Mellon rode up, and denouncing him as a &quot;bragging hound,&quot; slashed him
with her by no means light riding-whip severely over the head and shoulders.
After that day no one cared to say much against Kate Mellon.</p>
<p>Who was she, and where did she come from? that no one positively knew. When
The Den at Ealing (she so christened it; it was called Myrtle Farm before) was
to let, the neighbours thought the landlord would stand out of his rent for many
years. The house was a little, long, one-storied building, cut up into small
rooms; old, dilapidated, and damp. The stables were rotting with decay; the
barns untiled and tumbling down; the twenty or thirty acres of land attached
were swampy and unproductive. The place stood untenanted for half a year. Then,
one morning, an old gentleman arrived in a four-wheeled cab, went all over the
premises, had an interview with the proprietor, announced himself as Mr. Powker,
of the firm of Powker and Beak, of Lincoln's Inn, and within a fortnight the
lease was assigned to Miss Kate Mellon, spinster. The house was papered and
painted, and put in order; the stables were entirely altered and renovated, and
fitted with enamel mangers, and tesselated pavements, and bronze devices for
holding the pillar-reins, and all the newest equine upholstery; some of the
barns were converted into carriage-houses, and one of the largest into a
tan-strewn riding-school; the land was thoroughly drained and laid out in
paddocks, where there were tan-rides and all kinds of jumps, and an artificial
brook, and every thing for a horse's proper tuition. Miss Mellon did not receive
visits from the neighbouring gentry, principally lawyers and merchants, who went
regularly to business, and always stared hard at her when their wives were not
with them; nor did she attend the parish-church; but she gave largely to all the
parochial charities, and in the winter had a private soup-kitchen of her own. I
believe that occasionally gin was dispensed in small glasses to the
soup-recipients; but all was done under the superintendence of Freeman, the
staid stud-groom, who had followed her from Yorkshire, where she said &quot;her
people&quot; lived. But she never said any thing more about them; and you would as
soon have got a comic song out of an oyster as a word from Freeman. And she
prospered wonderfully. She had to make large additions to the stables, and to
build rooms for an increased force of grooms; and even then there were always
half a score of horses waiting on her list for admission, either for training or
cure. She made money rapidly, and kept it: no better woman of business ever
breathed; in a big ledger she scrawled her own accounts, and, as she boasted,
could always tell to a farthing &quot;how she stood.&quot; With all this she was generous
and hospitable; paid her grooms good wages, and gave frequent dinner-parties to
her friends,--dinner-parties which scandalised her solemnly pompous neighbours,
who would look aghast at the flashing lamps of the carriages dashing up the
little carriage-drive to fetch away the company at the small hours, or would
listen from beneath their virtuous bedclothes to the shouts of mirth and
snatches of melody which came booming over the hushed fields.</p>
<p>One of these dinner-parties--that to which she had invited Beresford--is just
over. The French windows in the long, low dining-room are open; the table is
covered with the remains of dessert, and some of the guests have already lighted
cigars. Kate Mellon heads her table still; she never leaves the room to the
gentlemen,--&quot;It's slow,&quot; he says; &quot;women alone fight or bore;&quot; so she remains.
You can catch a good glimpse of her now under that shaded swinging
moderator-lamp; a little woman, with a closely-knit figure, long violet eyes,
and red-gold hair, taken off over her ears, twisted in a thick lump at the back
of her head, and secured with a pink coral comb of horse-shoe shape. She is
dressed in white spotted muslin, fastened at the throat and waist with coral
brooch and clasps. Her nose is a little too thick for beauty; her lips full; her
mouth large, with strong white teeth; her hands are white, but large and sinewy;
and the tones of her voice are sharp and clear. She is shouting with laughter at
a song which a jolly-looking young man, sitting at the little cottage-piano at
the end of the room, has just finished; and her laugh makes the old rafters ring
again.</p>
<p>&quot;I always yell at that song, Tom,&quot; she says. &quot;I haven't heard it since last
winter, the day that 'Punch' Croker dined here, and we gave him an olive to
taste for the first time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He's tremendous fun, is Punch,&quot; said the singer. &quot;Why didn't he dine here
to-day? Is he out of town?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He's got a moor with Penkridge,&quot; said Beresford, who was sitting next the
hostess. &quot;By Jove, how bored Penkridge will be before he's done with him!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Punch has not got much to say for himself,&quot; said a tall man, in a dark
beard. &quot;I've had him down to dine with me when I've been on guard at the Bank,
and, 'pon my soul, he's never said a word the whole night!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He was at Baden with us last year,&quot; said Beresford; &quot;and when we used to sit
and smoke our weeds after dinner in front of the Kursaal, he used to bore us so
with staring at us and saying nothing, that we used to pay him to go away.
Subscribe five francs, or thalers--according to our means, you know--and send
him to play at the tables to get rid of him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He's not a bad fellow, though, Punch Croker,&quot; said Kate. &quot;And what I like in
him is, he never lets out that he don't know every thing!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, that's just it!&quot; said the tall guardsman. &quot;Just after the Derby, I was
confoundedly seedy, and my doctor told me I wanted more ozone.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What's that, Jack?&quot; asked the man at the piano.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, it's some air or stuff that you don't get by sitting up all night, and
lying in bed till three. From the doctor's I went to the Rag, and found Meaburn
there; and we'd just agreed to dine together, when Punch Croker came in. I told
Meaburn to hold on, and we'd get a rise out of Punch. He asked us if we were
going to dine, and we said yes, and that he might dine too, if he liked. And I
told him I'd got some ozone, and asked him his opinion, as a sort of fellow who
knew those things, how it should be cooked. He thought for one moment, and then
said, perfectly quietly, 'Well, if you have it before the cheese, it should be
broiled.' Never let on that he didn't know what it was; never changed a muscle
of his face,--give you my word!&quot;</p>
<p>They all laughed at this, and then the tall guardsman said, &quot;It's a great
bore, though, to get a reputation for stupidity. It's as bad as being supposed
to be funny. People are always expecting you to say stupid things, and sometimes
it's deuced hard to do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Poor old Charleville!&quot; said Beresford; &quot;we all sympathise with you, old
fellow, though no one can imagine you ever found any difficulty in being stupid.
Comes natural, don't it, old boy?&quot;</p>
<p>Captain Charleville didn't seem to relish this remark, and was about to reply
angrily, when Tom Burton, the man who had been singing, struck in hastily with,
&quot;Well, it's better to be or to seem stupid, than to be stupid and have the
credit of being clever. Now there's Northaw, only said one decent thing in his
life; and because that has been told about, fellows say that he's a deuced
clever fellow, and that there's more in him than you'd think.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What was the one good thing he did say?&quot; asked Kate.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, it was one day when he was out with the Queen's last season.
Stradwicke was there, and Pattan, and Bellairs, and a lot of men; and Northaw
was in a horrid bad temper,--had got up too soon, or something, and was as rusty
as Old Boots; so while he was fretting and fuming about, and blackguarding the
weather, and his stirrup-leathers, and every thing else, Tom Winch rode up to
him. You know Tom Winch, son of great contractor, timber-man, builds bridges,
and that sort of thing. 'Morning, my lord!' says Tom Winch. 'Morning,' says
Northaw, as sulky as a bear. 'What do you think of my new horse, my lord?' says
Tom Winch. 'Ugly brute,' says Northaw, looking up; 'ugly, wooden-legged brute;
<i>looks as if he'd been made at home</i>.&quot;</p>
<p>Burton rose during the laugh that followed his story, and rang the bell. &quot;I
must be off,&quot; he said; &quot;I've rung to have the phaeton round, Kitty. Charleville,
you'll come with me? I can find room for you, Beresford.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No; thanks,&quot; said Beresford; &quot;I rode down. Oh, tell them to bring my horse
round too,&quot; he added to the servant.</p>
<p>&quot;Wait five minutes, Charley,&quot; said Kate Mellon in an undertone; &quot;let us have
a quiet talk after they're gone. I've got something to say to you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, good night, Kate; good night, old lady. If you pick up any thing good
in Yorkshire, let's how, there's a Stunner! I've promised to mount my sister
next season, and she sha'n't ride any thing you don't warrant. Good night,
Beresford; good night, old lady;&quot; and with hearty hand-shakes to Kate, and nods
to Beresford, Captain Charleville and Tom Burton took themselves off.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, Charley,&quot; said Kate, leaning forward on the table while Beresford lit a
fresh cigar and threw himself back in his chair,--&quot;now, Charley, tell us all
about it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;About what?&quot; asked Beresford, rolling the leaf of his cigar round with his
finger. &quot;That is good, by Jove! You say you want to talk to me, and you begin by
asking me to tell you all about it!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I mean about yourself. You're horribly low, and dull, and slow, and
wretched. You've scarcely spoken all the evening, and you ate no dinner, and you
drank a great deal of wine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're a pretty hostess, Kitty! You've checked off my dinner like the keeper
of a <i>table-d'hôte</i>.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, you know you might drink the cellar dry, if you liked. But you're all
out of sorts, Charley; tell me all about it, I say!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You certainly are a strange specimen, Stunner,&quot; said Beresford, still calmly
occupied with his cigar-leaf; &quot;but there's a wonderful deal of good in you, and
I don't mind telling you what I wouldn't say to any one else. I'm done up,
Kitty; run the wrong side of the post; distanced, old lady. I've been hit
frightfully hard all this year; my book for the Leger looks awful; I owe pots of
money, and I am very nearly done.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My poor Charley!&quot; said the girl, bending forward, with deep interest in her
face. &quot;That certainly is a blue look-out,&quot; she continued,--for however earnest
was her purpose, she could not but express herself in her slang metaphor. &quot;Is
there nothing to fall back upon?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing; no resource, save one--and that I'm going to look after at
once--marriage!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Marriage!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes; if I could pick up a woman with money, I'd settle down into a regular
quiet humdrum life. I'd cut the turf, and ride a bishop's cob, and give good
dinners, and go to church, and be regularly respectable, by Jove! I should make
a good husband, too; I think I should; only--the worst of it is, that these
women with money, by some dispensation of nature, are generally so frightfully
hideous.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said the girl, who had pushed her hands through her hair, and then
clenched them tightly in front of her, and who was looking at him with staring,
earnest eyes. &quot;I can't fancy you married, Charley; that's quite a new view of
matters; and, as you say, the rich women are not generally pretty. You can't
have every thing, Charley?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Beresford, gloomily. &quot;I know that; and it would be deuced hard
lines to have to take a Gorgon about with you, and to have to glare at a
plain-headed woman sitting opposite you for the rest of your life. But need
must--what am I to do?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Charley,&quot; said the girl, suddenly tilting her chair on to its front legs,
and drumming with her right hand upon the table; &quot;look here. You can't have
every thing, you know, and it's better to make the running over open ground, no
matter how heavy, than to dash at a thick hedge where there may be water and
Lord knows what on the other side. Don't hurry it so, Charley; you'll get
pounded without knowing it, and then there'll be nothing to pull you through.
You can't expect every thing in a wife, you know, Charley. If you got money, you
couldn't look for rank, you know, eh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, how you do talk about it, old lady!&quot; said Beresford, flicking the ash
off his cigar. &quot;No; I'm not exacting. I wouldn't care about her pedigree, so
long as she was well weighted.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's right; of course not, Charley! I should think you'd find some one,
Charley; not grand, you know, but good and honest, and all that. Not very
beautiful either, perhaps, but not ugly, you know; and one who'd love you,
Charley, and be true to you, and take care of you, and make you a good wife.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I know, and all that sort of thing; but where is she to come from?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You might find such a one, Charley, where you never looked for it, perhaps;
one who could bring you a little fortune, all honest money, and who could tell
you of her past life, which you never dreamed of, and need not be ashamed of.
There might be such a one, Charley!&quot;</p>
<p>She had slid from her chair to the ground, and knelt, with her hands on his
knees, looking eagerly into his face. Her eyes gleamed with excitement she had
pushed her hair back from her forehead, and her lips were parted in eager
anticipation of his words. They came at length, very slowly. At first he turned
pale, and caught his breath for an instant; then gently lifted her hands, and
muttered between his teeth, &quot;It's impossible, Kate; it can't be!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Impossible!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It can't be, I tell you. What would--there, you don't understand these
things, and I can't explain. It's impossible! I was a fool to start the subject.
Now I must go. Good-by, child; write me a line from Scarborough; they'll forward
it from the office. Won't you say good-by?&quot;</p>
<p>He gripped her cold, passive hand, and two minutes afterwards she heard the
sound of his departing horse's feet on the carriage-drive.</p>
<p>For a while Kate Mellon stood motionless, then stamped her foot violently,
and sank into a chair, covering her face with her hands, through which the tears
welled slowly. Rousing herself at length, she hurried to a writing-table, pulled
out a gaudily-decorated <i>papier-mâché</i> blotting-book, and commenced
scrawling a letter. She wrote hurriedly, passionately, until she had covered the
sheet, running her gold pen-holder through the tangled mass of hair at the back
of her head, and twisting a stick of sealing-wax with her teeth the while. The
letter finished, she skimmed through it hastily, put it in an envelope, and
directed it to &quot;F. Churchill, Esq., <i>Statesman</i> Office, E.C.&quot;</p>

<h4><a name="div1_05" href="#div1Ref_05">CHAPTER V.</a></h4>
<h5>&quot;THERE'S NOTHING HALF SO SWEET IN LIFE.&quot;</h5>
<br>
<p>Four days had slipped away since Churchill's first arrival at Bissett Grange,
and he had begun to acknowledge to himself that they had passed more pleasantly
than any previous time in his recollection. The mere fact of getting out of
business was a great relief to him; he revelled in the knowledge that he had
nothing to do; and, in odd times and seasons,--as he lay in bed of nights, for
instance,--he would chuckle at the thought that the coming morrow had for him no
work and no responsibilities in store; and when he went up to dress himself for
dinner, he would settle down into an easy-chair, or hang out of the open window,
and delight in the prospect of a good dinner and delightful society, of music
and conversation, from which no horrid clock-striking would tear him away, and
send him forth to dreary rooms and brain-racking until the small hours of the
morning. Society, music, and conversation! It is true that he enjoyed them all;
and yet, when he came to analyse his happiness, he was fain to admit that they
all meant Barbara Lexden. As in a glass darkly, that tall majestic figure moved
through every thought, and sinuously wound itself round every impulse of his
heart. At first he laughed at his own weakness, and tried to exorcise the
spirit, to whose spells he found himself succumbing, by rough usage and hard
exercise. There is probably nothing more serviceable in getting rid of a sharp
attack of what is commonly known as &quot;spooniness&quot;--when it is accidental, be it
remembered, not innate--than the eager pursuit of some healthy sport. Men try
wine and cards; both of which are instantaneous but fleeting remedies, and which
leave them in a state of reaction, when they are doubly vulnerable; but shooting
or hunting, properly pursued, are thoroughly engrossing while they last, and
when they are over necessitate an immediate recourse to slumber from the fatigue
which they have induced. In the morning, even should opportunity offer, the
&quot;spoony&quot; stage is at its lowest ebb; it is rarely possible to work oneself up to
the proper pitch of silliness immediately after breakfast, and then some farther
sporting expedition is started, which takes one out of harm's way. But in
Churchill's case even this remedy failed; he was not much of a sportsman; not
that he shot badly, but that he was perpetually <i>distrait</i>, and when
reminded of his delinquencies by a sharp, &quot;Your bird, sir!&quot; from one of his
companions, would fire so quickly, and with so much effect, as to mollify the
speaker, and lead him to believe that it was shortsightedness, and not being a
&quot;Cockney&quot;--that worst of imputations amongst sportsmen--that led the stranger to
miss marking the rise of the covey. And yet Churchill displayed no lack of keen
vision in making out the exact whereabouts of a striped petticoat and a pair of
high-heeled Balmoral boots which crossed a stile a little in advance of the
servants bringing the luncheon; but these once seen, and their wearer once
talked to, sport was over with him for the day, and he strolled back with Miss
Lexden, at a convenient distance behind Miss Townshend and Captain Lyster, who
led the way.</p>
<p>&quot;You are soon tired of your sport, Mr. Churchill,&quot; said Barbara; &quot;I should
have thought that you would have followed ardently any pursuit on which you
entered.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You do me a great deal too much honour, Miss Lexden,&quot; replied Churchill,
laughing; &quot;my pursuits are of a very desultory nature, and in all of them I
observe Talleyrand's caution,--<i>Point de zèle</i>.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you carry that out in every thing?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In most things. Mine is a very easy-going, uneventful, unexcitable life; I
live thoroughly quietly; <i>da capo</i>--all over again; and it is seldom that
any thing breaks in upon the routine of my humdrum existence.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then,&quot; said Barbara, looking saucily up at him from under her hat--&quot;then you
do not follow the advice which your favourite Talleyrand gave to the ambassadors
whom he was despatching, <i>tenez bonne table, et soignez les femmes</i>.&quot;</p>
<p>Churchill looked up, and for an instant caught her glance; then he laughed
lightly, and said,</p>
<p>&quot;Well, not exactly; though the dinners at the club, even the modest joint and
the table-beer, are not by any means to be despised; and as for the rest of it,
not being a diplomatist, Miss Lexden, I have no occasion to play the agreeable
to any one save in my own house, and, being a bachelor, the only woman I have to
see to as properly <i>soignée</i> is my old mother, and I <i>do</i> like her to
have the best of every thing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your mother lives with you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, and will, so far as I can see, until the end of the chapter.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She--you must be very fond of her!&quot; said Barbara, as by a sudden impulse,
looking up at his kindling eyes and earnest face.</p>
<p>&quot;I am very proud of her,&quot; he replied; &quot;she is more like my sister than my
mother; enters into all my hopes and fears, shares all my aspirations, and
consoles me in all my doubts.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;More like your wife, then,&quot; said Barbara, with a slight sneer. &quot;You have in
her a rare combination of virtues.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Churchill; &quot;not rare, I am disposed to think. I don't suppose
that, in your class,--where maternity means nothing in particular to sons, and
merely chaperonage, or the part of buffer, to ward off paternal anger for bills
incurred, to daughters,--such characters flourish; but in mine they are common
enough.&quot;--(&quot;A little touch of old Harding's Radicalism in that speech, by Jove!&quot;
thought he to himself.)</p>
<p>&quot;I don't exactly fallow your reference to my class as distinct from your own.
I suppose we mix amongst pretty much the same people, though as individuals we
have not met before. But,&quot; added Barbara, with a smile, &quot;now that that great
occurrence has taken place, I don't think we need enter into lengthy
disquisitions as to the charms and duties of maternity; indeed, we will not, for
I shall ask you to observe the only conditions which I require from my friends.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And they are--?&quot; asked Churchill.</p>
<p>&quot;<i>Qu'on exécute mes orders</i>, as Louis Napoleon said when asked what
should be done on the Second of December. So long as my commands are obeyed, I
am amiability itself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And suppose they were disobeyed?&quot; asked Churchill again.</p>
<p>&quot;Then--but I won't tell you what would happen! I don't think you'll ever have
the chance of knowing; do you think you shall? Not that I like amiable people
generally--do you? Your blue-eyed girls, with colourless hair like
blotting-paper, and--but I forgot I was talking to an author. I suppose you're
making fun of all I say?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;On the contrary,&quot; said Churchill, struggling to keep his gravity, and
producing a small memorandum-book, &quot;I purpose making a note of that description
for use on a future occasion. There is a spiteful simplicity in that phrase
about 'blotting-paper hair' which is really worth embalming in a leader.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now I know you're laughing, and I hate to be laughed at--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;By no means; I subscribe the roll. I am now one of the <i>âmes damnées</i>,
sworn to obey the spell of the sorceress; and the spell is--?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing. Never mind. You will know easily enough when it is once uttered.
Now they're coming back to us, and I've lost my glove. Have you seen it? How
very absurd!&quot;</p>
<p>As she spoke, they came up with Lyster and Miss Townshend, who were waiting
for them at a gate leading into the Grange lands.</p>
<p>&quot;How slowly you walk, Miss Lexden!&quot; said Lyster; &quot;Miss Townshend thought you
never would come up with us.&quot;</p>
<p>Miss Townshend, with much curl-tossing and laughter, declared she had never
said any thing of the kind.</p>
<p>&quot;Quite otherwise,&quot; replied Barbara; &quot;from the earnest manner in which you
were carrying on the conversation, there could be no doubt that it was you who
were going ahead.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I?--I give you my word I was merely talking of scenery, and telling Miss
Townshend how much I should like to show her Rome.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And promising, when there, to enter into the spirit of the proverb, and do
as the Romans--eh, Captain Lyster?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, ah,--yes! I see what you mean. That's not so bad, eh, Mr. Churchill? You
might use that in some of your thingummies, eh? Though I don't know that there's
much difference between Rome and any other place, after all. It's rather like
London, I think.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is it?&quot; said Churchill. &quot;I confess my short sojourn there gave me a very
different idea.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I don't know; it's mouldier and more tumbledown, certainly, but there
are some parts of it that are uncommonly like the unfinished streets in the new
part of Belgravia. And people walk about, and eat and drink, and flirt, you
know, just as they do in town. There's a Colosseum at Rome, too, as well as in
London, only the one in Rome isn't in such good repair.&quot;</p>
<p>This was said in perfect good faith; and the others shouted with laughter at
it, in the midst of which they came to a stile, joining upon the Paddock, and
here they parted into couples again, only this time Churchill and Barbara took
the lead.</p>
<p>&quot;I think she's made another <i>coup</i>,&quot; said Lyster, looking at them, as
they immediately fell into earnest conversation. &quot;She certainly is
wonderful,--never misses fire!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If I were Barbara, I should be careful about any flirtation with Mr.
Churchill. They're dreadful people, these poets, you know,--at least so I've
always heard; and if you give them any encouragement, and then won't marry them,
they cry out, and abuse you terribly in books and newspapers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That would be awful!&quot; said Lyster; &quot;as bad as having your letters read out
in a breach-of-promise case, by Jove! Never could understand how fellows wrote
such spoony letters to women,--never could fancy how they thought of all the
things they said.&quot;</p>
<p>And yet I think, if Captain Lyster had been rigorously cross-examined, he
must needs have confessed that he himself had never, throughout the whole course
of his previous life, gone through so much actual thinking as since he knew Miss
Townshend. There was, perhaps, no species of flirtation in which he was not an
adept, for he had sufficient brains to do what he called the &quot;talkee-talkee;&quot;
while his natural idleness enabled him to carry on a silent <i>solitude à deux</i>,
and to make great play with an occasional elevation of the eyebrow or touch of
the hand. He had run through a thorough course of garrison hacks, and had seen
all the best produce of the export Indian market; he had met the beauties of the
season at London balls and in country houses, and his listlessness and languor
had hitherto carried him through scot-free. But now he was certainly &quot;fetched,&quot;
as his friends would call it, and began to feel an interest in Miss Townshend
which he had never felt for any other person. There had been a two days'
flirtation between him and Barbara Lexden; but they were so utterly unsuited,
that, at the end of that time, they, as it were, showed their hands to each
other, and then, with a laugh, threw up their cards. The flirtation was never
renewed; but a curious, strange friendship,--exhibited in the conversation about
the coming professor,--and always half raillery on both sides, existed between
them. But &quot;this little Townshend girl,&quot; as he thought of her in his dreamy
reveries, was quite another matter; she was so jolly and good-tempered, and so
approachable, and never gave herself any airs, and never wanted talking to or
that sort of thing, but could amuse herself always, as chirpy as a bird, by
Jove! And these attributes had an immense amount of weight with taciturn Fred
Lyster, who, moreover, had recently discovered a bald spot about the size of a
sixpence at the top of his back-parting, and who immediately perceived imminent
age, determined on marriage, and even thought of making his will. And little
Miss Townshend walks by his side, and prattles away, and laughs, saucily tossing
her curls in the air, and is as merry as possible; save when, stealing an
occasional glance from under her hat, she detects her companion's eyes very
earnestly fixed upon her, and then a serious expression will settle on her face
for an instant, and something like a sigh escape her.</p>
<p>We are a strange race! Here are two couples engaged in the same pursuit, and
yet how different is the process! While Lyster is strolling idly by Miss
Townshend's side, and listening to her little nonsense, Churchill and Barbara
are stepping ahead, thoroughly engrossed in their conversation. He is talking
now, telling her of a German adventure of his; how, with some other students, he
made the descent of the Rhine on one of the timber-rafts; how they came to grief
just below the Lôrely, and were all nearly drowned. He tells this with great
animation and with many gestures, acting out his story, as is his wont; and
throughout all he has a sensation of pleasure as he catches glimpses of her
upturned earnest face, lighting up at the special bits of the narrative, always
eager and attentive. His earnestness seems infectious. She has dropped all her
society drawl, all her society tricks and byplay, and shows more of the real
woman than she has for many a day. They talk of Germany and its literature, of
Goethe and Schiller and Heine; and he tells her some of those stories of
Hoffmann which are such special favourites with <i>Bürschen</i>. Thus they pass
on to our home poets; and here Barbara is the talker, Churchill listening and
occasionally commenting. Barbara has read much, and talks well. It is an utter
mistake to suppose that women nowadays have what we have been accustomed, as a
term of reproach, to call &quot;miss-ish&quot; taste in books or art. Five minutes' survey
of that room which Barbara called her own in her aunt's house in Gloucester
Place would have served to dispel any such idea. On the walls were proofs of
Leonardo's &quot;Last Supper&quot; and Landseers &quot;Shoeing the Horse;&quot; a print of
Delaroche's &quot;Execution of Lady Jane Grey;&quot; a large framed photograph of Gerome's
&quot;Death of Cæsar;&quot; an old-fashioned pencil-sketch of Barbara's father, taken in
the old days by D'Orsay long before he ever thought of turning that pencil to
actual use; and a coloured photograph--a recent acquisition--of a girl sitting
over a wood-fire in a dreamy attitude, burning her love-letters, called &quot;L' Auto
da Fé.&quot; On the bookshelves you would have found Milton, Thomas à-Kempis, <i>
David Copperfield</i>, <i>The Christmas Carol</i>, a much-used Tennyson, Keats,
George Herbert's Poems, Quarles' <i>Emblems</i>, <i>The Christian Year</i>,
Carlyle's <i>French Revolution</i>, Dante, Schiller, <i>Faust</i>, Tupper (of
course! &quot;and it is merely envy that makes you laugh at him,&quot; she always said),
<i>The Newcomes</i>, and a quarto Shakespeare. No French novels, I am glad to
say; but a fat little Béranger, and a yellow-covered Alfred de Musset are on the
mantelpiece, while a brass-cross-bearing red-edged Prayer-Book lies on the table
by the bed. Barbara's books were not show-books; they all bore more or less the
signs of use; but she had read them in a desultory manner, and had never
thoroughly appreciated the pleasure to be derived from them. She had never lived
in a reading set; for when old Miss Lexden had mastered the police intelligence
and the fashionable news from the <i>Post</i>, her intellectual exercises were
at an end for the day; and her friends were very much of the same calibre. So
now for the first time Barbara heard literature talked of by one who had
hitherto made it his worship, and who spoke of it with mingled love and
reverence--spoke without lecturing, leading his companion into her fair share of
the talk, mingling apt quotation with caustic comment or enthusiastic eulogy,
until they found themselves, to Barbara's surprise, at the hall-door.</p>
<p>I am glad that it is my province as historian to discourse to my readers of
the thoughts, impulses, and motives influencing the characters in this story,
else it would be difficult for me to convey so much of their inner life as I
wish to be known, and which yet would not crop out in the course of the action.
In writing a full-flavoured romance of the sensational order, it is not,
perhaps, very difficult to imbue your readers with a proper notion of your
characters' character. The gentleman who hires two masked assassins to waylay
his brother at the foot of the bridge has evidently no undue veneration for the
Sixth Commandment; while the marchioness who, after having only once seen the
young artist in black velvet, gives him the gold key leading to her secret
apartments, and makes an assignation with him at midnight, is palpably not the
style of person whom you would prefer as governess for your daughters. But in a
commonplace story of every-day life, touching upon such ordinary topics as walks
and dinners and butchers' meat, marrying and giving in marriage, running into
debt, and riding horses in Rotten Row,--where (at least; so far as my experience
serves) you find no such marked outlines of character, you must bring to your
aid all that quality of work which in the sister art is known by the title
pre-Raphaelitic, and show virtue in the cut of a coat and vice in the adjustment
of a cravat. Moreover, we pen-and-ink workers have, in such cases, an advantage
over our brethren of the pencil, inasmuch as we can take our readers by the
button-hole, and lead them out of the main current of the story, showing them
our heroes and heroines in <i>déshabille</i>, and, through the medium of that
window which Vulcan wished had been fixed in the human breast--and which really
is there, for the novelist's inspection--making them acquainted with the inmost
thoughts and feelings of the puppets moving before them.</p>
<p>When Barbara went to her room that night and surrendered herself to Parker
and the hair-brushes, that pattern of ladies'-maids thought that she had never
seen her mistress so preoccupied since Karl von Knitzler, an <i>attaché</i> of
the Austrian Embassy,--who ran for a whole season in the ruck of the Lexden's
admirers, and at last thought he had strength for the first flight,--had
received his <i>coup de grâce</i>. In her wonderment Parker gave two or three
hardish tugs at the hair which she was manipulating, but received no reproof;
for the inside of that little head was so busy as to render it almost insensible
to the outside friction. Barbara was thinking of Mr. Churchill--as yet she had
not even thought of him by his Christian name, scarcely perhaps knew it--and of
the strange interest which he seemed to have aroused in her. The tones of his
voice yet seemed ringing in her ears; she remembered his warm, earnest manner
when speaking from himself, and the light way in which he fell into her tone of
jesting badinage. Then, with something like a jar, she recollected his
suppressed sneer at the difference in their &quot;class,&quot; and her foot tapped angrily
on the floor as the recollection rose in her mind. Mingled strangely with these
were reminiscences of his comely head, white shapely hands, strong figure, and
well-made boots; of the way in which he sat and walked; of--and then, with a
start which nearly hurled one of the brushes out of Parker's hand, she gathered
herself together as she felt the whole truth rush upon her, and knew that she
was thinking too much of the man and determined that she would so think no more.
Who was he, living away in some obscure region in London among a set of people
whom no one knew, leading a life which would not be tolerated by any of her
friends, to engross <i>her</i> thoughts? Between them rolled a gulf, wide and
impassable, on the brink of which they might indeed stand for a few minutes
interchanging casual nothings in the course of life's journey, but which
rendered closer contact impossible. And yet--but Barbara determined there should
be no &quot;and yet;&quot; and with this determination full upon her, she dismissed Parker
and fell asleep.</p>
<p>And Churchill--what of him? Alas, regardless of his doom, that little victim
played! When old Marmaduke gave the signal for retiring, Churchill would not, on
this night, follow the other men into the smoking-room. The politics, the
ribaldry, the scandal, the horsey-doggy talk, would be all more intolerable than
ever; he wanted to be alone, to go through that process, so familiar to him on
all difficult occasions, of &quot;thinking it out;&quot; so he told Gumble to take a
bottle of claret to his room, and, arrived there, he lit his old meerschaum, and
leant out of the window gazing over the distant moonlit park. But this time the
&quot;thinking it out&quot; failed dismally; amid the white smoke-wreaths curling before
him rose a tall, slight grateful figure; in his ear yet lingered the sound of a
clear low voice; his hand yet retained the thrill which ran through him as she
touched it in wishing him &quot;good night.&quot; He thought of <i>her</i> as he had never
thought of woman before, and he gloried in the thought: he was no love-sick boy,
to waste in fond despair, and sicken in his longing; he was a strong, healthy
man, with a faultless digestion, an earnest will, a clear conscience, and a
heart thinking no guile. There was the difference in the rank, certainly--and in
connexion with this reflection a grim smile crossed his face as he remembered
Harding, and his caution about &quot;swells&quot;--but what of that? Did not good
education, and a life that would bear scrutiny, lift a man to any rank? and
would not she--and then he drew from his pocket a dainty, pearl-gray glove
(Jouvin's two-buttoned, letter B), and pressed it to his lips. It <i>was</i>
silly, ladies and gentlemen, I admit; but then, you know, it never happened to
any of <i>us</i>; and though &quot;the court, the camp, the grove&quot; suffer, we have
the pleasure of thinking that the senate, the bar, the commerce of England, and
the public press, always escape scot-free.</p>
<p>Breakfast at Bissett Grange lasted from nine--at the striking of which hour
old Sir Marmaduke entered the room, and immediately rang the bell for a huge
smoking bowl of oatmeal porridge, his invariable matutinal meal--until twelve;
by which time the laziest of the guests had generally progressed from
Yorkshire-pie, through bacon, eggs, and Finnan haddies, down to toast and
marmalade, and were sufficiently refected. Barbara was always one of the last;
she was specially late on the morning after the talk just described; and on her
arrival in the breakfast-room found only Mr. and Mrs. Vincent, who always
lingered fondly over their meals, and who, so long as the cloth remained on the
table, sat pecking and nibbling, like a couple of old sparrows, at the dishes
within reach of them; Captain Lyster, who between his sips of coffee was dipping
into <i>Bell's Life</i>; and Sir Marmaduke himself, who had returned from a
brisk walk round the grounds and the stables and the farm, and was deep in the
columns of the <i>Times</i>. But, to her astonishment, the place at table next
hers had evidently not yet been occupied. The solid white breakfast-set was
unused, the knives and forks were unsoiled; and yet Mr. Churchill, who had
hitherto occupied that place, had usually finished his meal and departed before
Barbara arrived. This morning, however, was clearly an exception; he had not yet
breakfasted, for by his plate lay three unopened letters addressed to him.
Barbara noticed this--noticed moreover that the top letter, in a long shiny pink
envelope, was addressed in a scrawly, unmistakably female hand, and had been
redirected in a larger, bolder writing. As she seated herself, with her eyes, it
must be confessed, on this dainty missive, the door opened, and Churchill
entered. After a general salutation, he was beginning a half-laughing apology
for his lateness as he sat down, when his eye lit on the pink envelope. He
changed colour slightly; then, before commencing his breakfast, took up his
letters and placed them in the breast-pocket of his shooting-coat.</p>
<p>&quot;This is horrible, Miss Lexden,&quot; he said, &quot;bringing these dreadful hours into
the country; here--where you should enjoy the breezy call of incense-breathing
morn, the cock's shrill clarion, and all the rest of it--to come down to your
breakfast just when the bucolic mind is pondering on the immediate advent of its
dinner.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Be good enough to include yourself in this sweeping censure, Mr. Churchill,&quot;
said Barbara. &quot;I was down before you; but I accepted my position, nor, however
late I might have been, should I have attempted--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I congratulate you, sir,&quot; interrupted Mr. Vincent, dallying with a lump of
marmalade on a wedge of toast,--&quot;I congratulate you, Mr. Churchill, on a
prudence which but few men of your age possess.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are very good, but I scarcely follow you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I saw you--I saw you put away your letters until after breakfast. A great
stroke that! Men generally are so eager to get at their letters, that they
plunge into them at once, before meals little thinking that the contents may
have horrible influence on their digestion.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am sorry to say that I was influenced by no such sanitary precautions. My
correspondence will keep; and I have yet to learn that to read letters in the
presence of ladies is--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pray, make no apologies, as far as I am concerned,&quot; said Barbara, with a
curl of her lip and an expansion of nostril; &quot;if you have any wish to read your
doubtless important correspondence--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have no such wish, Miss Lexden. <i>Litera scripta manet</i>; which, being
interpreted, means, my letters will keep. And now, Mr. Vincent, I'll trouble you
for a skilful help of that game-pie.&quot;</p>
<p>Churchill remained firm; he was still at breakfast, and his letters remained
unopened in his pocket, when Barbara left the room to prepare for a drive with
Miss Townshend. As they reëntered the avenue after a two hours' turn round the
Downs, they met Captain Lyster in a dog-cart.</p>
<p>&quot;I have been over to Brighton,&quot; he explained; &quot;drove Churchill to the
station. He got some news this morning, and is obliged to run up to town for a
day or two. But he's coming back, Miss Lexden.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is he, indeed!&quot; said Barbara. &quot;What splendid intelligence! I should think,
Captain Lyster, that, since the announcement of the fall of Sebastopol, England
has scarcely heard such glorious news as that Mr. Churchill is coming back to
Bissett.&quot; And, with a clear, ringing laugh, she pulled the ponies short up at
the hall-door, jumped from the carriage, and passed to her room.</p>
<p>&quot;She don't like his going, all the same,--give you my word,&quot; said Lyster,
simply, to Miss Townshend.</p>
<p>And she did not. She coupled his sudden departure with the receipt of that
pink envelope and the address in the feminine scrawl. Who was the writer of that
letter? What could the business be to take him away so hastily? With her head
leaning on her hand, she sits before her dressing-table pondering these things.
It certainly <i>was</i> a woman's writing. Is this quiet, sedate, self-possessed
man a flirt? Does he carry on a correspondence with-- And if he does, what is it
to her? She is nothing to him--and yet--who <i>can</i> it be? It was a woman's
hand! She wonders where he is at that moment; she would like to see him just for
an instant.</p>
<p>If she could have had her wish, she would have seen him by himself in a
railway-carriage, an unheeded <i>Times</i> lying across his knee, and in his
hand a little pearl-gray kid-glove.</p>

<h5>THE COMMISSIONER'S SHELL EXPLODES.</h5>
<br>
<p>When the party assembled for dinner on the day of Mr. Churchill's hurried
departure from the Grange, they found they had an addition in the person of Mr.
Commissioner Beresford, who arrived late in the afternoon, and did not make his
appearance until dinner-time. A man of middle height and dapper figure, always
faultlessly dressed; slightly bald, but with his light-coloured hair well
arranged over his large forehead; with deep-sunk, small, stony-gray eyes, a nose
with the nostrils scarcely sufficiently covered, and a large mouth, with long
white teeth. He had small white--dead-white--hands, with filbert nails, and very
small feet. There was in the normal and ordinary expression of his face
something sour and mordant, which, so far as his eyes were concerned,
occasionally faded out in conversation, giving place to a quaint, comic look;
but the mouth never changed; it was always fox-like, cruel, and bad. There was
no better-known man in London; high and low, rich and poor, gentle and simple,
all had heard of Charley Beresford. Citizen of the world, where was he out of
place? When there was a tight wedge on the staircase of Protocol House on the
Saturday nights when Lady Helmsman received; when at a foot-pace the fashionable
world endured hours of martyrdom in procession to the shrine which, once
reached, was passed in an instant, according as sole trophy the reminiscence of
a bow,--Mr. Beresford was to be seen leaning over the stoutest of dowagers, and
looking fresh and undrooping even when pressed upon by the pursiest of
diplomatists. When the noble souls of the Body Guards were dismayed within the
huge carcasses which contained them because it was whispered that the 180th
Hussars intended to wear white hats on their drag to the Derby, and to deck
their persons and their horses with blue rosettes--both which insignia had
hitherto been distinctive of the Body Guards--it was Charley Beresford who was
applied to on the emergency; and who, on the Derby morning, turned the tables
completely by bringing the Body Guards from Limmer's straw-thatched and
amber-rosetted to a man. The 180th and their blue were nowhere; and &quot;Go it,
yaller!&quot; and &quot;Brayvo, Dunstable!&quot; were the cries all down the road. When Mr.
Peter Plethoric, the humorous comedian of the Nonpareil Theatre, wanted some
special patronage for his benefit, &quot;Charley, dear boy!&quot; was his connecting link
with that aristocracy whose suffrages he sought. He went into every phase of
society: he had an aunt the widow of a cabinet minister, who lived in Eaton
Square; and an uncle a bishop, who lived in Seamore Place; and he dined with
them regularly two or three times in the season, lighting his cigar within a few
yards of the house, and quietly strolling down to the Argyll Rooms, or to the
green-room of the theatre, or to the parlour of a sporting-public to get the
latest odds on a forthcoming fight. He turned up his coat-collar of late when he
visited these last-named places, and the pugilistic landlords had orders never
to pronounce his name, but to call him &quot;Guv'nor;&quot; it would not do for an
official high in her Majesty's service to be recognised in such quarters. Before
his aristocratic friends obtained for him his commissionership, his name was one
of the most common current amongst the Fancy; but since then he had eschewed
actual presence at the ring, as he had blue bird's-eye handkerchiefs, cigars in
the daylight, and nodding acquaintance with broughams in the park. &quot;<i>Il faut
se ranger</i>,&quot; he used to say; &quot;it would never do for those young fellows down
at the Office to think that I was or ever had been a fast lot; and those
confounded Radical papers, they made row enough about the appointment, and
they'll always be on the look-out to catch me tripping.&quot; He little knew that his
fame had preceded him to the Tin-Tax Office; that all the old clerks were
prepared to receive him with something between fear and disgust, all the young
ones with unmingled admiration; that daily bulletins of his dress and manners
were circulated amongst the juniors, and that those who could afford it dressed
at him to a man.</p>
<p>He was four-and-thirty when he got his appointment, and he had held it about
two years. There was even betting that the promotion would &quot;go in the office;&quot;
that Mr. Simnel, the secretary, a very clever man, would get it; that the
vacancy would not be filled up; and various other rumours. But the Chancellor of
the Exchequer felt that Mr. Simnel had been going a little too much ahead
lately, acting on his own responsibility; and as the widow of the cabinet
minister (who owned a borough in Devonshire) and the bishop concurrently
attacked the Premier, that nobleman gave way, and Charles Beresford exchanged
the dreariness of Bruges, in which dull Belgian city of refuge he had been for
some months located, for a seat in the board-room at Rutland House. His uncle
and aunt, through their respective solicitors, bought up his outstanding debts,
and settled them at a comparatively low rate (his Oxford ticks had been settled
years ago out of his mother's income); and he came into a thousand a year, paid
quarterly, free and unencumbered. A thousand a year, in four cheques on the Bank
of England in January, April, July, and October, ought to be a sufficiency for
an unmarried man; but with Charles Beresford, as with a good many of us, the
mere fact of the possession of money gave rise to a wild desire for rushing into
unlimited expense. To belong to three clubs--the Beauclerk in Pall Mall,
aristocratic and exclusive; the Minerva (proposed thereat by the bishop),
literary and solemn; the Haresfoot, late and theatrical;--to have capital rooms
in South Audley Street; to keep a mail-phaeton and pair, with a saddle-horse and
a hunter during the season; to give and join in Greenwich and Richmond dinners;
to be generous in the matter of kid-gloves and jewelry; to have a taste (and to
gratify it) in choice wines; to make a yearly excursion to Baden, and when there
to worship extensively at the shrine of M. Benazet; to be a connoisseur in art,
and a buyer of proofs before letters, and statuary, and tapestry, and antiques;
to be miserable without the possession of an Opera-stall; all these vagaries,
though pleasant, are undeniably expensive; and at the end of his second year of
office Charles Beresford found that he had spent every farthing of his income,
and owed, in addition, between three and four thousand pounds.</p>
<p>He could not compound with his creditors; he dared not go through the Court,
for &quot;those rascally papers&quot; would then have been down on him at once, and his
official appointment might have been sacrificed. The Government just then had
two or three black sheep, about whom people had talked, among their
subordinates; and Beresford might have been the Jonah, sacrificed to allay the
storm of virtuous public indignation. Besides, though his great soul might have
been won over to include in his schedule Messrs. Sams and Mitchell, Mr.
Stecknadel, the tailor of Conduit Street, and Hocks, with whom his horses stood
at livery, he could not inscribe the names of the Irrevocable Insurance Company,
to whom for the money borrowed he had given the names of two substantial friends
as sureties; or of Mr. Parkinson, solicitor, of Thavies Inn, who &quot;did his
paper,&quot; but required another signature on the back. So Mr. Charles Beresford was
forced to confess himself &quot;done up,&quot; &quot;cornered,&quot; and &quot;tree'd;&quot; and only saw one
way out of his difficulties--a good marriage. There was no reason why his final
chance should not succeed, for he was a very pleasant, agreeable fellow when he
chose; had a capital tenor voice, and sang French and German songs with
sparkling effect and irreproachable accent; acted well in charade; talked all
sorts of styles,--could be earnest, profound, sentimental, flippant, literary,
or ribald, as occasion presented; waltzed with a gliding, long, swinging step,
which was the envy of all the men who saw him; was sufficiently good-looking,
and had something like a position to offer.</p>
<p>Behold him, then, seated at Sir Marmaduke's table next to Miss Townshend, and
with Barbara Lexden immediately opposite to him. He has been rattling on
pleasantly enough during dinner, but has never forgotten the object of his life;
he is aware that Barbara for him is not an available <i>parti</i>, with position
certainly, but without money, and with extravagant notions; but he has some
recollection of having heard that Mr. Townshend was something approaching to a
<i>millionnaire</i>, and he determined to satisfy himself upon the point without
delay.</p>
<p>&quot;Not at all,&quot; he says, referring to something that has gone before; &quot;not at
all. It's all very well for you, Sir Marmaduke, whose lines have been cast in
pleasant places, to talk so; but for us poor fellows who have to work for our
living, this rest is something delightful.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Work for your living!&quot; growls out the old gentleman. &quot;A pack of lazy
placemen. Egad! the fellow talks as though stone-breaking were his occupation,
and he'd just straightened his back for five minutes. Work for your living! Do
you call sticking your initial to the corner of a lot of figures that you've
never read, work? Do you call scrawling your signature at the bottom of some
nonsensical document, to prove that you're the 'obedient, humble servant,' of
some idiot whom you've never seen, work? Do you call reading the--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now stop, Sir Marmaduke,&quot; said Beresford, laughing; &quot;I bar you there. You
mustn't repeat that <i>rococo</i> old rubbish about reading the newspaper and
poking the fire as the sole work in a Government office. That <i>is</i>
slander.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am bound to say,&quot; said Mr. Townshend pompously, &quot;that when, in my capacity
either as one of the directors of the East-India Company, or Prime Warden of the
Bottle Blowers' Company, I have ever had occasion to transact business with any
of the Government establishments, I have always found myself well treated.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am delighted to hear such testimony from you, sir,&quot; said Beresford, with
some apparent deference, and inwardly thinking that the two positions named
looked healthy as regards money.</p>
<p>&quot;God bless my soul!&quot; bawled Sir Marmaduke. &quot;Here's a man drives up in a big
carriage, with a powdered-headed jackass to let down the steps, and then he
'testifies' that he gets a messenger to take in his name and that he isn't
insulted by the clerks. I wish with all my heart, Townshend, that you were a
poor man with a patent to bring out, or a grievance to complain of, or an
inquiry to make, and you'd devilish soon see the reception you'd get.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I hear,&quot; said Mr. Vincent, with a mind to turn the conversation &quot;that a new
system of refreshment-supply has recently been introduced into some of our
public departments. I have a nephew in the Draft-and-Docket Office, whom I
called upon about one o'clock the other day, and I found him engaged upon some
very excellent <i>cotelettes à la Soubise</i>, which he told me were prepared in
the establishment. That appears to me a most admirable arrangement.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very admirable,&quot; growled Sir Marmaduke &quot;for the public, who are paying the
young ruffians for eating their Frenchified rubbish. By heavens! a clerk at
ninety pounds a year, and a made-dish for lunch!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Quite right, Mr. Townshend,&quot; said Stone; &quot;they feed stunningly now, and
don't drink badly either. By the way, Beresford, I'm agent for Goupil's house at
Bordeaux, and I could put in a capital cheap claret into your place, just the
thing for your fellows in the hot weather. The tenders are out now, and a word
from you would serve me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But, surely,&quot; said Barbara, laughing, &quot;if, as Sir Marmaduke says, you don't
work now, Mr. Beresford, you'll be less inclined than ever after M. Goupil's
claret.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sir Marmaduke is an infidel, Miss Lexden,&quot; said Charley. &quot;Send in your
tender, Stone, and Goupil's Medoc shall be a fresh incentive to the virtuous
Civil Servants!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Let him rave, my dear!&quot; said Sir Marmaduke; &quot;let him rave, as your idol Mr.
Tennyson says. What he calls work, I call make-believe humbug. What I call work,
is what my godson--what's his name---Churchill (what the deuce has he gone away
for?) does, night after night, grinding his headpiece--that sort of thing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What Churchill is that, sir?&quot; asked Charley.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Churchill is a literary man, I believe,&quot; said Miss Townshend;
&quot;wonderfully clever--writes, you know, and all that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Frank Churchill! I know him,&quot; replied Beresford. &quot;Has he been down
here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes; he only left this morning.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He seems a very good sort of fellow,&quot; said Lyster generously, for he didn't
quite like the tone of Beresford's voice, and did not at all like the manner in
which the Commissioner was paying quiet attention to Miss Townshend. &quot;He's made
himself a general favourite in a very short time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, that he has,&quot; said Miss Townshend; &quot;he's very clever, and not at all
conceited, and--oh! he's so nice.&quot;</p>
<p>Barbara said nothing.</p>
<p>&quot;I had a few words with him about the money-article yesterday,&quot; said Mr.
Townshend; &quot;but I must say his views were scarcely so defined as I could have
wished.&quot;</p>
<p>Beresford had listened attentively to these remarks. He thought he perceived
a certain <i>tendresse</i> in Miss Townshend's manner of speaking of Churchill,
which did not at all accord with his present views. So he said,</p>
<p>&quot;No, Mr. Townshend; that's not Churchill's peculiar line. He's a poor man,
though, as you say, Miss Townshend, a clever one. And he has some object in
working hard, for he's going to be married.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To be married?&quot; exclaimed Miss Townshend, looking across at Barbara.</p>
<p>&quot;To be married?&quot; exclaimed Barbara, flushing scarlet. The next instant she
turned deadly cold, and could have bitten her tongue out for having spoken.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, well!&quot; said old Miss Lexden, who up to this time had been engaged in a
confidential culinary chat with Mrs. Vincent; &quot;that's always the way. Poor
thing: I pity the young woman. These sort of persons always stay out all night,
and ill-treat their wives, and all that kind of thing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dear, dear!&quot; said Mrs. Vincent; &quot;leg-of-mutton <i>ménage</i> and
batter-pudding, perhaps; no soup or fish. Dear, dear! what unwholesome things
these love-marriages are!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But nobody said that it is a love match,&quot; said Miss Townshend. &quot;Perhaps the
lady is an heiress, whom Mr. Churchill has captivated by his talent.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; growled Sir Marmaduke, with a sardonic grin; &quot;an heiress who has been
struck with his articles on the Reformatory question, or has become completely
dazzled by the lucidity of his views on the Maynooth Grant. A leader-writer in a
daily newspaper is just the romantic youth that heiresses fall in love with.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now do be quiet, Sir Marmaduke, with your horrid sarcasm, and let us hear
what the lady is like. Do tell us, Mr. Beresford,&quot; said Miss Townshend.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I have no idea of her personal appearance,&quot; replied Beresford. &quot;Every
body says she's very nice, and that the marriage is coming off at once--that's
all I know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your curiosity will soon be gratified, with a very little trouble,&quot;
interrupted Lyster. &quot;You can ask Mr. Churchill himself--he's coming back
to-morrow.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Coming back!&quot; exclaimed Beresford.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, to-morrow,&quot; replied Lyster, and added, between his teeth, &quot;your little
plot will soon be spoilt, my boy.&quot;</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards, when the ladies left the table, Barbara did not accompany
the rest, but went straight to her own room. There she seated herself at the
open window, which looked out upon the lawn and upon the high downs beyond, over
which the yellow-faced moon was rising in solemn beauty. And Barbara nestled
into the great easy-chair, which she had pulled forward, and rested her chin on
her hand, and looked upon the grand picture of varied light and shade with eyes
that saw nothing of the beauty, and with a heart that comprehended it not. Down
in the hollow lay a little farm, gray and cold and stony, as are such buildings
in Sussex, and containing at that time a sleeping, snoring family; for the
farmer, a thrifty man, had to be up betimes, and candlelight might as well be
spared, and hard-working folk must rest. He did not think much about the moon,
this Sussex farmer, nor did his hinds, two of whom were then snoring in the
red-tiled barn just on the shoulder of you hill; but the glorious lamp of night
was as much in their thoughts as she was in those of Barbara Lexden, who had
copied out &quot;The moon is up, by Heaven! a lovely eve,&quot; from <i>Childe Harold</i>,
and knew Alfred de Musset's wild lines on the same subject by heart, and had
gone in for the romantic business about it, and done some very effective bits of
flirtation, in which the goddess Luna was made good use of. But the moon was
nothing now to Barbara, whose mind was full of a far more worldly object, and
whose foot was tapping impatiently on the floor. Going to be married? Then it
was all accounted for--that letter with the feminine <i>griffe</i>, which he had
pocketed immediately and read apart, and his hurried departure for town. Going
to be married! What business had he, then, to come down there, and talk and act
as though no engagement fettered him--to talk, indeed, as though no notion of
matrimony had ever crossed his mind? Could he--? No; that was impossible. He
could not have been playing with her--making a fool of her? What was that he had
said about difference of class in marriage? Ay, that settled the question; the
<i>fiancée</i> was probably some dowdy woman, who could make a pie, and mend his
clothes, and keep their maid-of-all-work in order. Well, the man was nothing to
her--but she hoped he might be happy. It was getting very dull at Bissett, and
she should suggest their departure to her aunt. They had invitations for several
nice houses; and General Mainwaring's was not far off, and Boyce Combe was
there, and Harvey Grenville; so that she should be sure of plenty of fun. She
had not seen Boyce Combe since the last Woolwich ball, and then he had been so
horribly absurd, and had talked such ridiculous nonsense. He was so amusing,
Major Combe; and--and then Major Combe's handsome, vacuous, simpering
countenance, which for a moment had risen in Barbara's mind, faded again, and in
its place there came a genial, clever, sensible face, with merry eyes and
laughing mouth, and Major Combe's &quot;ridiculous nonsense&quot; seemed wretched
balderdash as contrasted with Frank Churchill's pleasant talk.</p>
<p>A knock at the door, following which promptly little Miss Townshend glides
into the room. A nice little girl, as I have remarked; a charming little being,
bright and winning, but not the sort of person for a companion when one is in
that state so well described as &quot;out of sorts.&quot; Who, I wonder, is pleasant
company for us in a real or fancied trouble? Certainly not the enthusiastic
gusher who flings his or herself upon our necks, and insists upon sharing our
sorrow,--which is a thorough impossibility. Certainly not the pseudo-moralist
who tells us that all is for the best, and quotes Scripture, and suggests that,
though we have had to retire from Palace Gardens and live in Bedford Row, there
are many outcasts then sleeping on the steps of Whitechapel Church; and that,
though our darling's life may be trembling in the balance, there are
fever-courts and pestilence-alleys, in no house of which &quot;there is not one
dead.&quot; Certainly not the lively friend who thinks that &quot;rallying&quot; is the best
course for binding the broken heart and setting at rest the perturbed spirit,
and who accordingly indulges in one perpetual effervescence of mild sarcasm and
feeble teasing. Miss Townshend belonged to this latter class; and entered the
room with a little skip and a long slide, which brought her to Barbara's side.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, ho! and so we're annoyed, are we, and won't come among our friends? We
sit and sulk by ourselves, do we?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot possibly imagine what you mean, Alice,&quot; said Barbara coldly. &quot;Take
care, please; you're standing on my dress.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, of course not, poor darling, she can't imagine! But, without any joking,
Barbara, it <i>is</i> too bad.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What is too bad, Alice?&quot; asked Barbara, without moving a muscle. She had a
tremendous power over her face, and, when she chose, looked as impassible as the
Sphynx, &quot;staring straight on with calm eternal eyes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now, don't be silly, Barbara dear,&quot; exclaimed Miss Townshend, who was
getting rather annoyed because her friend had not gone off into hysterics. &quot;You
know well enough what I mean; and it is a shame, a horrible shame! Who would
have thought that that learned clever man could have been such an incorrigible
flirt? There now,&quot; putting up her hands, &quot;you know perfectly well who I mean.
And he did carry on with you in the most shameful manner--and going to be
married all the time! Not that I'm sure you're not rightly served, Barbara. It's
just the sort of thing you've been doing all your life, you know; but, still,
one doesn't expect it in a man, does one, dear? I wonder--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<i>I</i> wonder when you'll have common sense, Alice. It's time, if what you
told me this morning be true.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;O Barbara darling! O Barbara! don't remind me of it. Oh, how miserable
you've made me! And you--you don't care one pin, when you know I'm so wretched.&quot;
And putting her handkerchief to her eyes, little Miss Townshend hurried out of
the room.</p>
<p>And what of the girl who &quot;didn't care one pin&quot;? who had just been rallied
upon having been made a fool of by a man--a man, moreover, for whom every hour
of her life proved to her that she cared? Pride, love, vexation, doubt,--all
these had influence on that throbbing heart; and she flung herself on her bed in
a flood of tears.</p>

<h5>TOUCHING A PROPOSAL.</h5>
<br>
<p>When Captain Lyster rose on the following morning, he had made up his mind to
the commission of a very serious deed. A long course of reflection as he lay
awake in the watches of the night, and the discovery, real or imaginary, of a
further diminution of hair on the crown of his head, had determined him upon
asking Miss Townshend to become his wife without any further delay. There was
something in her fresh, cheery, pleasant manner that specially appealed to this
<i>blasé</i> cynic; she was so unlike the women he had been accustomed to mix
with in society, who were generally weak imitations of Barbara Lexden, or
opinionless misses, who held &quot;yea&quot; and &quot;nay&quot; to be the sole ingredients
necessary in their conversation; in fact, this chattering girl, who said every
thing uppermost in her mind, who had capital spirits perennially flowing, and
who was natural without being either arrogant or &quot;miss-ish,&quot; had completely
enslaved him. He might have pottered on in silent admiration for some time
longer, but that he had been greatly annoyed by Beresford's manner to Miss
Townshend on the preceding evening; there was something in the Commissioner's
easy familiarity, both during dinner and afterwards, which signally raised
Lyster's wrath. He had towards Beresford that singular feeling, that compound of
distrust, detestation, contempt, and fear, which we experience instinctively for
any rival; and his love for this girl was far too serious a matter to permit any
tampering with his plans. A good fellow, Fred Lyster; a kind-hearted,
straightforward, honourable man, with very little guile; lazy, to a certain
extent selfish, and considerably spoilt; but with an innate sense of right
carrying him through many difficulties, and with a stout heart and a clear brain
to support him under any trials.</p>
<p>He loved this girl, and he wanted to know whether his love was returned. To
get at this information he saw but one way--a proposal. I have before said that
he knew every trick and turn of flirtation; but this was something of far deeper
import than a flirtation; means which he had previously used to ascertain &quot;how
he stood&quot; with the temporary object of his affections, and which had elicited
the satisfactory glance, hand-pressure, or word, he would have now deemed
degrading both to himself and to her. His regard for her had been growing
throughout the past season, and was rapidly culminating. He had watched her
attentively, and studied all her movements, with a satisfactory result. He felt
that she was a little fast, certainly; but that fastness he was convinced
resulted from the mere overflow of animal spirits, and not from any desire to
please in men's eyes by affectation of men's ways. That she was an heiress he
didn't care one bit about--he had plenty for both; and if she came to him, any
thing that she had should be settled on herself. But how to ask her? Ah, how
long did that pair of hair-brushes remain suspended over his head, while he
gazed vacantly into the dressing-glass before him as this question rose in his
mind! How often did he fling himself on the ottoman, nursing his foot and biting
his lip in a perplexity of doubt! He could not go down on his knees, and offer
his hand and heart, as they did on the stage; he could not write to her, either
formally or spasmodically--he had a wholesome horror of committing himself on
paper; he could not arrive at the knowledge he required through any third
person; in fact (here the hair-brushes went to work again), there was no way but
to take advantage of an opportunity, and propose. He must know his position,
too, at once. He could not bear to see that fellow Beresford hanging about her
as he had been the previous night. He'd do it that very day. His whole frame,
which had been pleasantly cooled by his shower-bath, tingled again at the mere
thought; and a faint empty feeling, something like that which he experienced
when insulted in the Engineers' mess-room at Salem by Poker Cassidy, came over
him. Would he get as well out of this as out of that encounter? Then he held his
own; and Cassidy, neatly drilled by a pistol-bullet through his ankle, limps
with a crutch to this day. But this was a very different matter.</p>
<p>It was a dull breakfast that morning. Barbara sent down intelligence of a
headache, and remained in her room; Miss Townshend had red rims to her pretty
eyes, had no smile for any one, looked miserable, and sat silent; her papa had
donned his very stiffest check cravat, and was, if possible, more pompous than
usual; Sir Marmaduke had had his porridge early, had gone out, and not returned;
old Miss Lexden always breakfasted in bed; and Mr. and Mrs. Vincent were utterly
upset by a burnt omelette, about which they conveyed dismay to each other by
eyebrow telegraph across the table. Only Major Stone was himself; and he bustled
about, and made tea, and passed dishes, and joked and rallied in a way that
ought to have been of service, but which signally failed. When Mr. Beresford
entered the room, which was not until nearly all the others had finished their
meal, he seemed for a few moments staggered by the gravity of the assemblage;
but gliding into a vacant seat by Miss Townshend's side, he soon recovered his
spirits, and commenced a conversation in his accustomed bantering tone. His
neighbour seemed to brighten at once, and responded in her usual cheery manner,
greatly to the disgust of poor Fred Lyster, sitting opposite, who, over his cold
partridge, was still hard at work on the same problem which had occupied him
when over his hair-brushes, and who knew as little how to attain his end as
ever. He was glad when he heard Beresford say that business would require him to
ride into Brighton before luncheon, and that he must afterwards go round to the
stables and see whether his hack was all right after her journey down. His joy
toned down a little when Miss Townshend asked if said hack had ever carried a
lady, but rose again when Beresford declared that he should be sorry to see any
female friend of his on Gulnare's back.</p>
<p>&quot;It isn't that she's vicious,&quot; he explained; &quot;there's not an ounce of vice in
her. But there are so many things she can't bear--dirty children, and puddles,
and stone heaps in the road; and when she sees any of these she stands bolt
upright for two minutes on her hind-legs, and then starts off with her head
between her forelegs, and nearly pulls your arms out of their sockets.&quot;</p>
<p>So Miss Townshend declared with much laughter, and with many shoulder-shrugs
and exclamations of fright, that she could never think of mounting &quot;any thing so
dreadful;&quot; and Lyster, to his immense delight, saw Beresford leave the room,
light a big cigar on the steps, and clear off in the direction of the stables.
Stone had already departed on his various errands; Mrs. Vincent had fetched a
cookery-book from the library, and with her husband had retired to study it in
the embrasure of the window; and Miss Townshend, left the last at table, was
playing with a fragment of toast. Lyster knew her habits--knew that she was in
the habit of skimming the <i>Post</i> to learn the whereabouts of her friends;
and accordingly retreated quietly to the library.</p>
<p>Such a pleasant room, this! Not a bit of the wall to be seen for the dark oak
bookshelves, which, crammed with books, extended from floor to ceiling on every
side. A capital collection of books, in sober calf bindings (Sir Marmaduke once
said that brilliant bindings and glazed book-cases always reminded him of a man
with his hair parted down the middle, and could not understand what Barbara
meant by asking hi Mrs. Nickleby had been a Wentworth): theology, politics,
books of reference, poetry, drama, and history, all regularly ranged and
properly catalogued. Fiction had a very moderate compartment allotted to it; but
the round table in the middle of the room, and the ottoman at the far end, were
liberally strewn with volumes bearing the omnipresent yellow ticket of Mudie.
Immediately in front of the big bow-window, which was shaded by a sun-blind, and
through which you gazed over a lovely expanse of down, stood a huge
writing-table, on which was an inkstand that might have held half a pint, a
large blotting-pad, an oxydised-silver owl with ruby eyes erect on a
paperweight, and a bundle of quill pens, half split up, and all very much bitten
at the tops; for Sir Marmaduke, who was the principle occupant of the cane
writing-chair, was apt to get very energetic in his correspondence. Here, too,
the old gentleman indulged in the one literary occupation of his life--certain
translations of Horace, which he altered and polished year after year, intending
some time or other to show them to an old college friend, and then have a
gorgeous edition printed on toned paper for private circulation. Here, in a huge
iron safe, were kept big ledgers, and account-books of rents, rates, and
expenditure on the estates which gave three days' solemn investigation every
quarter to Sir Marmaduke and Major Stone; whereat there was much head-rubbing,
many appealing looks to the ceiling, and much secret checking of fingers under
the table, and reference to a ready-reckoner on the part of both gentlemen. And
here in a secret draw of the writing-table, lay a little packet, which the old
man would take out occasionally, would open, and sit gazing for half an hour
together at the contents. They were not much,--a faded blue ribbon, once worn,
with a little locket attached to it, round the throat of his old love at the
Bath Assemblies, where he first met her; a curl of hair, cut from her head after
death; and an ivory miniature, by Stump, of a dark girl, with big brown eyes,
and her hair banded tight to her forehead, and gathered into a large bow at the
top of the head. After an inspection of this drawer the old gentleman would walk
to the looking-glass, and glaring at his own reflection therein, would shake his
head in a very solemn manner; he would be very mild and quiet, and, as Gumble
noticed, would drink an extra bottle of claret during the evening.</p>
<p>When Lyster entered the room, he was annoyed to see that it was occupied. Old
Mr. Russell, the lawyer, was at the writing-table; and Mr. Townshend was seated
in an easy-chair close by, listening to the narration of some thick parchment
deed which the lawyer was going through. Their business was apparently at an
end, though; for Mr. Townshend said, &quot;Then it's satisfactory, Mr. Russell?&quot; to
which the old gentleman, with nothing but his finger-tips visible below his
cuffs, replied, &quot;I think we may assume so;&quot; and both gentlemen rose and left the
room. Being in a highly nervous state, Lyster did not like these proceedings a
bit. He wondered what that portentous-looking parchment was about--whether it
had any reference to old Townshend's testamentary disposition; whether it had
any thing to do with Miss Townshend. He thought he rather hated that old
Russell, though he had not much idea why. His time was coming on now; he
wondered how much longer before Miss Townshend would fetch the <i>Post</i>. Here
it was, on the round table, with the other papers. He took one up and looked at
it; but the type all ran together before his eyes, so he laid it down again, and
walked up to the mantelshelf, and glared at the big black clock in the middle,
and pulled the spear through the perforated fist of the bronze Diana on the top,
and pushed it backwards and forwards; and then walking to the writing-table, lit
a Vesta-match and blew it out. He plunged his hands into his pockets, and looked
down at his boots, apparently intently scrutinising their make, in reality not
seeing them in the least; then he took up a hare's-foot-handled paper-knife and
tapped his teeth with it, threw it down, and commenced a Polar-bear-like
promenade of the room.</p>
<p>The clock ticked solemnly on, and Captain Lyster was still pacing up and
down, when the door opened and Miss Townshend entered. She seemed surprised to
see any one in the room, and declared that she would not remain a minute, and
that she would take the greatest care not to disturb the Captain, who, she said
with a smile, was evidently, from his perturbed expression, engaged upon the
composition of an epic poem or other intense literary effort. At this remark the
Captain grinned feebly, and besought the young lady not to mind his
eccentricities, as he was full of them, though he was bound to confess he had
never been mad enough to contemplate writing a poem. And then Miss Townshend
smiled again, and seated herself at the round table, and taking up the <i>Post</i>
turned to the &quot;Fashionable intelligence,&quot; and was at once engrossed in the study
of who was where, and at what country seats &quot;select circles&quot; were being
&quot;hospitably entertained.&quot; Lyster went to the writing-table, and began
ornamenting the blotting pad with many spirited sketches, wondering all the time
whether he should get any better chance for his contemplated announcement, or
whether he should plunge into it at once. At last he thought he had an
opportunity. Miss Townshend suddenly exclaimed, &quot;Oh, Captain Lyster, here's news
for you! You recollect Mary Considine? Yes, I should think you did. Those
private theatricals at the Fenton's, where you and she--oh, I haven't forgotten
it. Well, there's something about her here; listen: 'We understand that a
matrimonial alliance will shortly take place between the Honourable Mary
Considine, youngest daughter of Lord Torraghmore, and Major Burt, of the Life
Guards.' That's Harry Burt, the straw-coloured one, isn't it? Poor Captain
Lyster! doomed to wear the willow.&quot;</p>
<p>The chance, the chance at last!</p>
<p>&quot;Surely, Miss Townshend,&quot; he commenced, &quot;you cannot imagine that I ever
seriously entertained any regard for Miss Considine. A very pleasant young lady,
full of spirits, and highly amusing, but not possessing the qualities which one
would look for in a wife. And you--can you imagine that in a house where <i>you</i>
were--where I was in the habit of seeing <i>you</i>--. Done, by Jove!&quot;</p>
<p>The last sentence, uttered under his breath, was evoked by the opening of the
door, and the entrance of Mr. Townshend, who looked more like the Ace of Clubs
than ever when he saw the couple in apparently close conversation. He at once
approached his daughter, and asked her if she had &quot;written that letter?&quot; She
said, with some tremulousness, &quot;No.&quot; Mr. Townshend then raised his voice, and
said he must beg--and with him &quot;beg&quot; sounded marvellously like &quot;insist&quot;--that
she would do it at once. So the young lady, albeit with tears in her eyes, went
dutifully off to obey her father's behests; the old gentleman sat down to the <i>
Times</i>, while Lyster glared at him from behind a book, and wondered whether
one could possibly call a man to account for interrupting one's conversation
with his daughter.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_08" href="#div1Ref_08">VIII.</a></h4>
<h5>TOUCHING ANOTHER PROPOSAL.</h5>
<br>
<p>Mr. Beresford meanwhile had strolled round to the stables, ascertained that,
with the exception of the loss of a little hair from her off-hock, Gulnare
seemed none the worse for her journey (horses never travel by rail without a
something), ordered his groom to bring her round in half an hour's time, and
made a cursory inspection of the other horses while finishing his cigar. At the
time appointed he mounted and rode away into Brighton, starting at first over
the Downs in a brisk canter, but gradually subsiding into a checked walk, which
ill suited Gulnare's fiery disposition, and made her rider break the current of
his thoughts by several behests of &quot;Steady now!&quot; &quot;Quiet, old lady;&quot; and such
like. Indeed, Mr. Beresford had quite enough subject-matter for reflection. He,
too, had been turning over in his mind the expediency of proposing to Miss
Townshend, and had almost determined upon its being the right thing to do. The
objection which he had urged in his discussion with Kate Mellon, that money and
ugliness generally went together, would not hold good here. Miss Townshend was
pretty and presentable; she was not clever, certainly; but so long as she was
able to talk about Shakespeare and the musical glasses, that was all which the
world would require of her in the way of conversation, and that sort of jargon
would be easily picked up. She knew passably sufficient of the accomplishments
of society, and was, as times went, in a very good set. Her people belonged to
the plutocracy; but Beresford liked that rather than otherwise, recollecting how
far pleasanter than the sham state and starveling magnificence of some of his
aristocratic friends were the town-houses and country places of City magnates
and merchant princes, where every thing, from the sleek porter in the hall to
the new and massive salt-spoons on the table, spoke of wealth. To ascertain
whether his venture was a safe one was the object of Beresford's visit to
Brighton. He had known so many mushroom magnates, who, after a couple of seasons
of full-blown pride, had collapsed and tumbled into the mud from which they
sprung, that he took no man's monetary position on hearsay. He had met Mr.
Townshend at capital houses, and had seen his name in many apparently excellent
City ventures; but, then, had he not met at the Duke of Banffshire's Mr. Poyntz,
the great railway contractor, who two months afterwards smashed for a million
and a half? and did not half the peerage welcome as a friend and respect as a
banker the great Mr. Shoddy, who was at that moment engaged in oakum-picking in
expiation of his fraudulent practices? There must be no mistake on this head; it
would be a pretty thing if he, Charles Beresford, were not merely to find
himself after a year or two with a penniless wife upon his hands, but were also
to have the world talking about his <i>mésalliance</i>. As to the idea of
rejection, that had scarcely entered his head. He was generally liked by women,
and thought Miss Townshend no exception to the rule. Her father perhaps might
look for money, and then he should have to square him as best he could. But
Beresford argued to himself: these <i>nouveaux riches</i> generally look for
position; and if they cannot get rank for their girls, they like a good official
connexion. Did not Petter marry the daughter of old Dunkel, the West-India
merchant (by the by, she was a little woolly, though), simply through his being
Secretary to the Lakes and Fisheries Department? And a Commissioner at the
Tin-Tax ranked higher than that. Walbrook delighted to talk of &quot;my son-in-law's
connexion with the Government;&quot; and Dowgate Hill rejoiced in seeing a
fourth-rate Cabinet Minister or occasional Secretaries of Foreign Legations,
much beribboned, at his daughter's drums. As to whether he cared for the girl,
it scarcely entered into his mind to inquire; they would get on well enough; he
would let her have her own way, so long as she did not interfere with him; he
should keep up his hunting, but cut play of every kind; and if he got at all
bored, why then he would go into Parliament. Fortunately, he thought, he was not
like most men: he could get married without its interfering with any body; there
was no &quot;establishment&quot; to break up; no inhabitant of a Brompton villa to tear
her hair and use strong language until a liberal settlement was made; no jealous
girls to upbraid and-- As the thought of Kate Mellon and the recollection of his
last interview with her flashed into Beresford's mind, he started involuntarily,
and touched the mare with his spur. Gulnare jumped into the air, and started off
like an arrow. By the time he pulled her up, he was at the top of St. James's
Street, Brighton; and as he leisurely rode down the hill, he revolved in his
mind the means of arriving at an immediate knowledge of his intended
father-in-law's stability.</p>
<p>He was not long in arriving at his determination. Of all the men he knew,
Simnel, the secretary at the Tin-Tax Office, was the most knowing; and he and
Beresford were on the most intimate terms. Had Beresford been in town, he would
have consulted Simnel personally about this marriage business; as it was, he
thought that the secretary was the likeliest man to get for him the information
he required. This information must be had at once; as, once satisfied, he would
not give another evening's chance to Lyster or that man Churchill, in whose
wheel he had put so neat a spoke, but would commence immediately to clear the
course on which he hoped to win. So he turned into the Old Steine, and leisurely
dismounting at the door of the telegraph-office, resigned Gulnare into the hands
of a passing boy, to whom he was so intent on giving instructions as to walking
her gently up and down, that he did not observe &quot;that man Churchill&quot; pass him in
an open fly, the driver of which must have been stimulated by the prospect of a
large reward, as his horse was proceeding at a pace very rarely undertaken by
Brighton fly-cattle. But perfectly ignorant of the propinquity of the gentleman
with whose family history he had recently manifested so intimate an
acquaintance, Mr. Beresford entered the telegraph-office, and taking up one of
the printed slips, wrote the following message:</p>
<br>
<p class="center" style="font-size: smaller">&quot;<i>C. B., Brighton to Robert
Simnel, Tin-Tax Office, Rutland House, London</i>.</p>
<br>
<p>&quot;<i>Non olet pecunia</i>. Whether a round game with Townshend of Queensbury
Gardens would repay the necessary illumination. Reply; figures, if possible.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p>The clerk counted the words and grinned. When Beresford, after saying that he
would call for the answer, paid and walked out, the clerk carried the paper into
the inner room where the manipulator was busy with his ever-clicking needles,
and read the message out to him, grinning again; whereupon they both expressed
opinion that it was a &quot;rum start,&quot; and another of those &quot;games&quot; which supplied
the interesting youths employed by the Electric Telegraph Company with so many
topics of conversation.</p>
<p>Mr. Beresford put up his horse at a livery-stable, and then walked down
towards the sea to while away the time until the answer should arrive. He knew
Brighton thoroughly. He was a regular visitor from Saturday till Tuesday during
November and December, when he stayed at the Bedford, and generally dined at the
cavalry mess; but he had never seen the place in its autumnal aspect. Those who
only know Brighton in the winter would scarcely recognise her in September, when
she has more the aspect of Ramsgate or Margate. In place of the dashing
carriages, flys at half-a-crown an hour crawl up and down the King's Road, the
horses, perfectly accustomed to the dreary job, ambling along at their own
sleepy pace; the riding-masters are still to the fore, but for pupils, instead
of the brilliant <i>écuyères</i>, they have heavy, clumsy girls in hired habits
and hideous hats. All the officers of the cavalry regiment who can get leave,
take it; and those who cannot, devote themselves to tobacco in the solitude of
their barrack-rooms. The Esplanade is thronged with fat people from the
metropolitan suburbs, gorgeous Hebrews with their families from the Minories,
and lawyers' clerks with a week's holiday. The beach is covered with children
stone-digging and feet-wetting; with girls who have just bathed, with their hair
down their backs, and girls who are waiting for machines; with men selling
shell-toys, and women imploring purchase of crochet-dolls; with hilarious men
throwing sticks for their dogs to swim after; with contemplative men reading
books, and gazing off them vacantly across the sea; with drowsy men, supine,
with their hats shading their faces from the sun. The whole place is changed;
the rich hotel and shopkeepers have gone inland (Tunbridge Wells is a favourite
place of theirs) for relaxation, and their substitutes, goaded into madness by
the unchanging blue sky and burning brick pavement, are bearish and morose; men
wear plaid shooting-coats of vivid patterns in the afternoon, and women, in
flapping hats with draggled feathers, promenade in the Pavilion; Brill's
swimming-bath shuts up for painting and decoration; and there are people seen
walking on the Chain Pier.</p>
<p>In this abnormal state of affairs Mr. Beresford found himself any thing but
happy. He went to Mutton's and had some soup, and to Folthorp's and read the
papers; he strolled down the King's Road, and inspected the evolutions of
various young ladies who were disporting in the waves, and indulging the
passers-by with the gambols of Bloomsbury-super-Mare. Then he put his legs up on
a bench on the Esplanade, and smoked a cigar, and stared at the passers-by; and
then, after the lapse of a couple of hours, he walked back to the
telegraph-office, where he found a reply waiting for him. It was from Mr.
Simnel, and merely said:</p>
<p>&quot;<i>Olet</i>. Three stars in Leadenhall Street and Director of L. B. and S.
C. meaning ten thou. Plated heavily. If with good hand, play game.&quot;</p>

<h5>&quot;A LITTLE PROUD, BUT FULL OF PITY.*&quot;</h5>
<h5>(*Ben Jonson.)</h5>
<br>
<p>Although only twenty-four hours absent from Bissett, Frank Churchill during
that short period had undergone more mental conflict than is often suffered by
many men in a course of years. He had had full time for reflection, and had
availed himself of it to the utmost. While within the charmed circle he was
necessarily under fascination; but now, although the witch was any thing but
exorcised, he felt sufficiently himself to collect his thoughts, and he saw the
absolute necessity of coming to some fixed determination as to his future
conduct before he returned. Often before had he had occasion to weigh matters
almost as important as this, though of course of a different character; and he
was not the man to blink one jot of the attendant difficulties, or to
over-persuade himself as to the feasibility of his designs simply because he
wished them carried out. He was in love with this girl, then; he supposed that
must be granted? at all events, by analysis and comparison, that was easily
ascertained. Though, as the world goes, his life had been tolerably pure, he had
in his student-days, and in the time immediately subsequent, had his <i>
amourettes</i> and flirtations like the rest; but when he remembered what had
been his feelings for Gretchen, the fat and fair daughter of Anton Schütz, the
beery saddler; for Ernestine, the sentimental heiress of the Graf von
Triebenfeld; for Eugénie and Olympe, vestals of the Quartier Latin; or for any
of the half-hundred young ladies with whom during the earlier portion of his
London career he had gone through the usual bouquet-sending, cotillon-dancing,
Botanical-Fête-meeting flirtation,--he recognised at once that this was a very
different matter. Breakers ahead and all round! As for Barbara, he felt
conscious of no vanity in avowing to himself his perception of having excited
her interest, but whether sufficiently to induce her to listen to an offer he
could not imagine. Possibly, probably, she looked to making a brilliant
marriage: her beauty and accomplishments were her capital, and should be turned
to good purpose; and yet, as this idea passed through his mind, he had an
instinctive feeling that Barbara's proud spirit would revolt from any such
match, however much it might be pressed on her by her relations. Her relations!
ay, even granting the girl's acquiescence, <i>there</i> would be one of the
grand sources of difficulty: old Miss Lexden, rich, selfish, and narrow-minded,
would doubtless oppose such a marriage in every possible way; and how would Sir
Marmaduke look upon him, having come an invited and a welcome guest, and then
brought this discord into the family? And even suppose it arranged somehow, she
consenting and her friends satisfied, what was to be done with his mother, with
whom and in whose house he then resided? how and where was the rest of her life
to be passed? He could not live far from the office, where, thrice a week
always, and occasionally more frequently, he was engaged till past midnight; and
how would the brilliant beauty of the West be able to exist in the dreary
fastnesses of Great Adullam Street, or the arid desert of Tiglath-Pileser
Square? And then the narrow income--competence for one, a bare sufficiency for
two! His horse must be given up, but that he would not so much mind; his Club
(the Retrenchment) must be kept on, for business purposes, though he should of
course never spend any money there; and he must take to sixteen-shilling
trousers, and that sort of thing; all easy enough. But for her?--no brougham
(and fancy those tiny high-heeled <i>bottines</i> over the villanous
Mesopotamian pavement!), only an occasional Opera-box obtained from the <i>
Statesman</i> (situation high, surroundings queer, <i>claqueurs</i> and <i>amis
des artistes</i>), two or three balls in the season, and perhaps one
dinner-party at home, with the inevitable side-dishes and attendant
carpet-beater. Ay, and worse beyond!--children born and reared in that dingy
atmosphere, further expenditure to be met, perhaps sickness to be struggled
through, and all the household gods dependent on him,--on the soundness of his
health and the clearness of his brain, which failing, what had they to look to?
<i>Aïe de me!</i> that last thought settled the question. Let it fade out,
pleasant dream that it was; or rather let him crush it for ever! It was
impossible, and so let it pass. Down go the Spanish castles, away melt the
aerial estates; Duty's foot kicks away Alnaschar's basket, and there is the
hard, dry, unsympathetic, work-a-day world before him! He will go back to
Bissett, but only for a day, just to get his traps together and to make some
plausible excuse, and then will start off. This first week of his holiday has
been any thing but rest, and rest he requires. He will go to Scarborough--no!
not there, for reasons; but to some watering-place, and pitch pebbles into the
sea and lie fallow until he is compelled to return to work. Yes, that is the
right course--he determines on it finally as the train nears the Brighton
station; hopes must be crushed, and Duty must be obeyed. Duty has won the day
for once--and where is the pearl-gray glove now? At his lips, of course! Frank
Churchill has resolved upon doing his duty, and, like the drunkard in the old
story, is &quot;treating resolution.&quot;</p>
<p>Anxiety to test his newly-farmed determination must be strong, for he ordered
the flyman to drive as hard as he could to Bissett; but, cooling a little,
dismissed the man at the lodge-gates, and strolled through the avenue towards
the house. The leaves yet held their own; scarcely the slightest autumnal tint
had fallen on them; and the grand old avenue looked magnificent. The weather was
splendid; the sun shone brightly, while the air was clear and bracing; deer
bounded in the brushwood; and as Churchill stood rejoicing in the lovely view, a
cart laden with game, and driven by little Joe Lubbock, the head-keeper's boy,
emerged from the Home Copse, and made a pleasant feature in the landscape. All
around told of wealth and peace and English comfort; and as Churchill surveyed
the scene, he felt (as he had often felt) how great were the enjoyments of those
born to such heritage, and (as he had never felt) how well-disposed he should be
for the sake of those enjoyments to undertake the necessary responsibilities.
His Radicalism was of the very mildest nature; the free and independent electors
of Brighton or of Southwark would have scorned the feebleness of his ideas as to
the requirements of the people; he had no wish to alter the laws of
primogeniture, nor to see the furniture designed by Gillow or Holland emblazoned
with the &quot;swart mechanic's bloody thumbs;&quot;--indeed, it must be confessed that he
thought the &quot;swart mechanic,&quot; when out of his place and wrong-headed through
false leading, a very objectionable person. But he was in love, and wanted money
and position to enable him to forward his suit; and as the thought of some who
had both and did good with neither flitted across him, he stamped impatiently on
the gravel, and the fair view and all the sweet excellence of nature faded out
before his eyes.</p>
<p>He walked hurriedly on for a few paces, and then bethought him that somewhere
close in the neighbourhood was the gate leading to the fir-plantation in which
he had recently walked with Barbara on their return from the shooting-party. He
had the whole afternoon to do nothing in, and it would be pleasant to renew the
remembrance of that happy jesting talk. Memory, he thought rather bitterly, was
a luxury which it did not require either rank or riches to enjoy. He struck
across the dry crisp turf, and arrived at the gate; it opened on a short
gravelled walk, with low palings on either side, terminating in a rustic stile,
on the other side of which lay the fir-plantation. As Churchill entered the path
he saw a figure seated on the stile at the other end, and in an instant knew it
to be Barbara Lexden. Her head was bent, and she was leaning forward, idly
tracing figures on the turf with the point of her parasol. Churchill advanced
with a strange fluttering of his usually regular-beating heart; but she did not
appear to hear his footstep until he was close behind her, when she suddenly
turned round, and their eyes met. It was a trying time for both, but Barbara was
the first to speak.</p>
<p>&quot;So soon back, Mr. Churchill? We--that is, Sir Marmaduke was led to believe
that you would not return until the end of the week.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fortunately, Miss Lexden, my business in town was soon finished&quot; (&quot;Question
of settlement with the lawyer, or naming the day with the lady,&quot; thought
Barbara), &quot;and I got back as quickly as I could. How lovely this place looks!
Perhaps it seems doubly beautiful after twenty-four hours in London; but it
appears to me even fresher, calmer, and more peaceful than when I left it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That, I suspect, is your poetic imagination, Mr. Churchill. You were raising
Dryden the other night, and can now quote him to your own purposes. You know he
says:</p>
<div style="font-size: 8pt">
	<p class="t2" style="text-indent: -2px">'Winds murmured through the leaves
	his short delay,<br>
	And fountains o'er their pebbles chid his stay;<br>
	But, with his presence cheered, they cease to mourn,<br>
	And walks seem fresher green at his return.'&quot;</div>
<p>&quot;Aptly quoted, though the lines were addressed to a lady, and for 'his' read
'your.' I don't think that even the fountains in Trafalgar Square would be weak
enough to 'chide my stay.' But, apropos of poetic imagination, I am afraid I
disturbed you from some deep reverie.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You never were more mistaken,&quot; said Barbara, with a short laugh. &quot;I--I came
out on a much more unromantic expedition. I lost a glove a day or two ago,
and--and fancied I might have dropped it somewhere here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is this it?&quot; asked Churchill suddenly, taking from his pocket a
morocco-leather case, and producing from it the much-prized pearl-gray.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Barbara, glancing quickly at him from under her drooping eyelids;
&quot;that is it. How very fortunate!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I picked it up,&quot; said Churchill, &quot;as we returned from the shooting-party the
other day, and intended restoring it sooner, but forgot it. I am glad to be able
to do so now.&quot; He handed her the glove, looked her straight in the face, and
walked on silently by her side.</p>
<p>&quot;We have had a new arrival here since you left,&quot; said Barbara, after a pause,
swinging the glove slowly to and fro; &quot;a Mr. Beresford. You know him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Beresford? Oh, of the Tin-Tax Office! I have met him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are on intimate terms?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I--I have not that honour. Mr. Beresford moves in a different set to mine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That question of 'sets' seems to be one of paramount importance with you,
Mr. Churchill. How frequently you harp upon it!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is a question which we must necessarily bear in mind, Miss Lexden,&quot; said
Churchill, with emphasis; then smiling, added,--&quot;<i>Suum cuique</i>, which is
Latin, and unintelligible; 'the cobbler and his last,' which is English and
vernacular. But why did you ask?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Simply because he seems amusing, and likely to be popular here. I am sorry
we shall not have the opportunity of profiting by his high spirits, as aunt and
I will probably be leaving on Thursday.&quot;</p>
<p>One quick glance told her that this shot, if intended for mischief, had
signally failed. With perfect calmness Churchill replied,</p>
<p>&quot;And I also must manage to survive the loss of Mr. Beresford's conversation,
as I go to-morrow.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To-morrow!&quot; exclaimed Barbara; then, in her ordinary tone, &quot;Ah, to be sure,
you have of course so much to do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Churchill, smiling, &quot;for a month I hope to do little beyond
mooning on the beach and throwing pebbles into the sea.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Barbara quickly; &quot;that is, I believe, the usual thing under the
circumstances. And the place? the Isle of Wight, or Devonshire, of course?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Under the circumstances!&quot; he echoed. &quot;I beg your pardon, Miss Lexden, but I
fear we are at cross purposes. Under what circumstances?&quot;</p>
<p>(&quot;He braves it out to the last,&quot; thought Barbara; &quot;who would have thought
that he could have stooped to a shuffle, or degrade the woman he was engaged to,
by tacitly ignoring the fact?&quot;) Then she said, curling her lip, and tossing the
glove with a lightly contemptuous gesture,</p>
<p>&quot;Good news travels fast, Mr. Churchill. The fact of your forthcoming marriage
is known at Bissett.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<i>My</i> forthcoming marriage? It's a joke, Miss Lexden?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We have heard it as a fact.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And <i>you</i> believed it?&quot; said Churchill, turning white, while his lip
trembled visibly as he spoke.</p>
<p>&quot;Why should I not?&quot; After a pause, and in a low voice, &quot;Then you are not
going to be married?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Married, no! Miss Lexden, you must now listen patiently to what I should
otherwise have kept secret, knowing the folly I have been guilty of. If ever I
marry, Barbara Lexden will be my wife!&quot;</p>
<p>She started, and seemed about to speak.</p>
<p>&quot;One moment more,&quot; said he. &quot;You know how completely I understand the
difference in our position?&quot; (An impatient gesture from Barbara.) &quot;My
sensitiveness, pride--call it what you will--would have kept me silent. Now I
have spoken, and--Barbara--you must not keep me in suspense. Could it ever be
possible?&quot;</p>
<p>Perfectly colourless, she leant against the stile, but said nothing.</p>
<p>&quot;Miss Lexden, you <i>must</i> end this doubt.&quot;</p>
<p>Silently she placed the little glove in his hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Barbara! <i>my</i> Barbara!&quot; and she was folded to his heart.</p>
<br>

<h5>AT THE TIN-TAX OFFICE, No. 120.</h5>
<br>
<p>The Tin-Tax Office, as I have before had occasion to remark, is situated in a
wing of Rutland House; that noble building so well known to most Englishmen,
whence are issued those concise documents relating to unpaid arrears of public
imposts, and where the mulcting of the nation is carried on. The Tin-Tax is by
no means a bad office, as times go; though it is rather looked down upon by the
men in the Check and Counter-Check Department, and the Navigation Board, who
have offices in the same building. It used to be a great point of humour with
the wits of twenty years since to say that the appointments in the Tin-Tax
Office were given to sons of the faithful butlers of patriotic peers, and to
those eager constituents for whose placing-out in life the Members for Irish
boroughs are always petitioning with energy and perseverance worthy of the
horse-leech's daughters. And, indeed, the manners and customs of some of the
middle-aged clerks bear testimony to the truth of this report. They were good
enough fellows in their day--blundered on at their offices from ten till four;
dined cheaply at Short's, or Berthollini's, or the Cock; went half-price to the
Adelphi; occasionally supped at the Coal-Hole or the Cider Cellars; and went
home to their garrets in Islington with the perfect idea that they were
roystering dogs, and that the world did not contain many men who had drained
pleasure's goblet more thoroughly to the dregs than themselves. Most of them
married betimes--occasionally the landlady of their lodgings; more frequently
the pallid daughter of some fellow-clerk, after a flirtation begun over a round
game or &quot;a little music;&quot; most frequently some buxom lass met at seaside
boarding-house, or in the old paternal home, where they spent their leave of
absence. But we have changed all that; and junior clerks of the present day are
thoroughly and entirely different from their predecessors: the establishment of
the Civil-Service Commission, and the ordination of promotion by merit, have
sent quite a different class of men into the public service, and the subordinate
appointments of the Tin-Tax Office are held by men who have taken their degrees
at Oxford; who can turn &quot;Vilikins and his Dinah&quot; into Greek iambics; who can
tell you where Montenegro is, and what it wants; who have thoroughly mastered
the Schleswig-Holstein question; who are well up in the theory of
thermo-dynamics; and who dip into Jean Paul Richter for a little light
reading;--all excellent accomplishments, and thoroughly useful in the Tin-Tax
Office.</p>
<p>It is half-past twelve on a fine Saturday morning in the beginning of
October, and the six occupants of room No. 120 are all assembled, and all at
work; that is to say, four of them are writing, one is looking vacantly out of
the window, and one is reading the <i>Times</i>. No. 120 is at the top of the
building; a pleasant room when you reach it, looking on to the river, but up
four flights of steep stone stairs. No. 120 has always its regular number of
occupants; for when the chief clerk learns that a young gentleman has an undue
number of friends calling upon him during official hours, he causes the popular
man to be removed to No. 120, and after two trials of the stairs the visitors
prefer meeting their friend in the evening at some less Alpine retreat. So also,
when a young gentleman is in the habit of being perpetually waited upon by duns,
he makes interest to get moved into No. 120, and finds that his creditors
simultaneously urge their demands not in person, but through the medium of the
Post-Office. The head of the room is Mr. Kinchenton, that tall man with the
rounded shoulders, and grizzled head ever bent over his desk. Hard work has
bowed Mr. Kinchenton's back and silvered his hair; for he has been in the
Tin-Tax Office since he was sixteen years old, and though promoted under the old
system of seniority and length of service, no one could ever say that he had not
fairly won every step he got. Before he was sixteen, he was the hope and
pride--the prize scholar--of the Heckmondike Grammar-School, his father being
head-keeper to Lord Heckmondike, who placed the boy on the foundation of the
school, and, finding him apt and studious, obtained for him his appointment from
the Government of the day. No Adelphi at half-price, no Cider Cellars or
Coal-Hole, for young Kinchenton, who had a little bedroom in a little terrace
close by Kennington Common, where he was to be found every night, book in hand,
and happy as a prince. A poor little bedroom enough!--a wretched little bedroom,
with a white-dimity-covered tester-bed, two rush-bottomed chairs, a painted
chest of drawers, a rickety washhand-stand, and a maddening square of
looking-glass hanging against the wall. But to that garret came Sancho Panza and
the gaunt Don his master; came Gil Blas, and the beggar with his arquebuse, and
the Archbishop of Grenada; came cringing Tartuffe, and preposterous Sganarelle;
came wandering Rasselas and sage Imlac; came Ferdinand Count Fathom, swearing
Tom Pipes, and decorous Mr. Blifil. There the hard-working clerk laughed over
Falstaff's lovemaking and Malvolio's disgrace, or wept over Sterne's dead ass
and Le Fevre's regained sword; while his comrades Mace and Flukes were ruining
each other at billiards, and Potter and Piper were hiccuping noisy applause to
indecent songs.</p>
<p>When Mr. Kinchenton was forty years old, his income had reached the
bewildering amount of four hundred a year, and he thought he might indulge in
the luxury of a wife; so he took to himself a pretty little soft-eyed girl, the
daughter of an old gentleman who was a traveller, in the straw-bonnet line, and
who, when he was not driving about in a very high four-wheeled trap which did
its best to look like a mail-phaeton and signally failed in the attempt, lived
in the little terrace next door to Kinchenton's lodgings. After his daughter's
marriage, the old gentleman, who was a widower, gave up travelling, retired upon
his savings, and went to live with his son-in-law in a little house which
Kinchenton had taken in Camden Town, where the birth of a son crowned
Kinchenton's happiness. His adoration of this child was his weakest point: he
was always narrating its wonderful deeds to every body; and the men in the
office, with whom the little fellow was really a favourite, knew they could
always get late attendance overlooked or half-holiday granted if they asked
after little Percy, and sent him some trifling present.</p>
<p>It is well for the junior clerks of No. 120 that Mr. Kinchenton is the head
of the room; for the next in seniority, Mr. Dibb, is by no means a pleasant
person. Harsh, stiff, sectarian bigotry lurks in his coarse, close-cropped black
hair, and in the plaited folds of his huge white neckcloth; he invariably wears
a black dress coat, waistcoat, and trousers, creaking boots, and damp cloth
gloves. He is always ailing, and invariably changing his medical system: now
vaunting the virtues of blue-pill, now swearing by homoeopathy; he has been
rubbed and cracked and shampooed and galvanised; and once he tried hydropathy,
but came back in a week from Malvern no better, and apparently no cleaner, than
before his visit to Dr. Gully. He was one of the first-fruits of the noble
system of promotion by merit, having been transferred to Rutland House from some
provincial stronghold of the Tin-Tax Office, and report said that he had
originally been a schoolmaster in Bilston. He was hated by nearly all his
juniors, but respected by the heads for his conscientiousness and power of work;
and he was located in No. 120 to neutralise, to some extent, Mr. Kinchenton's
excess of good nature. The rank and file of No. 120 consisted of Mr. Prescott
and Mr. Pringle, junior clerks; Mr. Boppy, an old gentleman with a bald head and
a double eyeglass, who had arrived, through dint of long service, at a good
income, who was utterly useless, and who had no characteristic save his intense
dread of his wife; and Mr. Crump, who had been for twenty years an extra clerk,
and who, owing to an invincible stutter, had never been able to interest any one
sufficiently to procure him an appointment.</p>
<p>&quot;Devilish hot!&quot; said Mr. Pringle, a short, good-humoured-looking young man,
laying down his <i>Times</i> and opening his waistcoat; &quot;devilish hot! Crump,
there's a good fellow, open the door.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Crump looked up from his work, and said appealingly, &quot;I've got a st--a
st--a st--&quot; he would have said &quot;stiff neck;&quot; but long before he could reach the
word, Pringle interrupted him--</p>
<p>&quot;Strong hand; you've got a strong hand, I know, and the door sticks; that's
why I asked you. Boppy, my boy, I've not yet had time to ask you how you are.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, Pm well in health, thank you, Mr. Pringle,&quot; said Mr. Boppy, depositing
his pen on the desk, and rubbing his bald forehead; &quot;but I'm rather worried in
my mind.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What troubles my Boppy? Has the Bank reduced its rate of discount, so that
my Boppy's ingots are not worth quite so much per cent as they were yesterday;
or is it love that is sending him to grief? Has my Boppy been sporting with
Amaryllis in the shady side of Brompton Row, and has Mrs. B. found it out? Oh,
Bop!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nonsense, Mr. Pringle! I--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I must say that such remarks as those,&quot; interrupted Mr. Dibb, &quot;appear to me
to be very bad jokes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very likely, Mr. Dibb,&quot; retorted Pringle; &quot;but that's because you're the
quintessence of humour yourself. We can't all hope to make ourselves as
thoroughly genial and pleasant as you--can we, Crump?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I d--decline to s--to s--to say--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To say ditto to Dibb! Of course: you're my friend, and I knew you'd never
desert me. Now, Boppy, you were about to say something when you were interrupted
in that gentlemanly manner by our friend J. Miller; what was it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I was merely thinking that I'd try and take that dog home this
afternoon, and I'm rather doubtful as to how my wife will receive it, You see, I
bought him a week ago, and Simmons, the hall-porter here, has kept him for me in
the coal-cellar since then. He's a white Pomeranian dog, and the coal-cellar
don't suit him somehow; but I daren't take him to Putney until I'd somewhat
prepared Mrs. B.'s mind. So last night I read her several anecdotes of dogs,
where they were all faithful and friendly and clean, you know; and this
afternoon I shall take Spitz home, and--and say you gave him to me, I think, Mr.
Pringle, if you've no objection.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly, if you like it, I don't mind; any thing you please, Boppy, my
boy. Dogs as many as you like, and things of that sort; only, if Mrs. B. ever
finds white-kid gloves, or locks of hair, or patchouli-scented pink notes, don't
say they come from me--you understand? By the way, that reminds me. Prescott!
p'st! Prescott!&quot;</p>
<p>A tall, good-looking man of two or three-and-twenty, who was leaning his head
on one hand and staring out of the window, turned round and said dreamily,
&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What an amusing companion you are!&quot; said Mr. Pringle; &quot;what a charming
remark that was when you last spoke, an hour and twenty minutes ago! What was
it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't be an idiot, Pringle!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, it wasn't that; to be told to avoid an impossibility would have struck
me as novel. Never mind; I was going to ask who that was I saw you speaking to
at the King's Cross Terminus yesterday.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;At King's Cross?&quot; said Prescott, colouring; &quot;oh, that was a friend of mine,
a clergyman.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; said Pringle, quietly, &quot;I thought so. He had on a blue bonnet and a
black-lace shawl. Neat foot he's got; those parsons are always so particular
about their stockings!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't be an ass, George!&quot; growled Prescott, in an undertone.</p>
<p>&quot;All right, old boy!&quot; said Pringle, in the same key. &quot;Forgot we weren't
alone. Nobody heard, I think; but I'll soon change the subject;&quot; and he
commenced whistling <i>Il Bacio</i>, loud and shrill.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Pringle! Mr. Pringle!&quot; screamed Mr. Dibb.</p>
<p>Mr. Pringle held up his hand as if deprecating interruption until he had come
to the end of the bar, when he said, with mock politeness, &quot;Sir to you!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How often have I begged you, sir, not to whistle during official hours? It
is impossible for me to write my minutes while you're whistling.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Write your minutes!&quot; said Mr. Pringle. &quot;Sir, we have the authority of A.
Tennyson, Esquire, the Poet of the Age, if my honourable friend in the Isle of
Wight will so permit me to call him, for saying that</p>
<br>
<p class="center" style="font-size: 8pt">'Lightlier move the minutes fledged
with music.'</p>
<br>
<p class="continue">Though that even my whistling could make your minutes move
lightly, with due respect to Alfred, I doubt.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Kinchenton,&quot; cried Mr. Dibb, now a dirty white with rage, &quot;I must
request you, as head of this room, to call upon Mr. Pringle not to forget
himself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My dear sir,&quot; said Pringle, &quot;there's no one I think of so much.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;George,&quot; said Mr. Kinchenton quietly, &quot;pray be quiet!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly, Padre; I'm dumb! Thank Heaven and the Early Closing Association,
to-day's a half holiday, and we cut it at two.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, to be sure!&quot; said Kinchenton, anxious to atone for even the slight show
of authority which his previous words might have suggested; &quot;there are grand
doings this afternoon at the Eyres', at Hampstead. I'm going to take my Percy
there. Athletic sports, running, leaping, and all the rest of it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ha! ha!&quot; said Pringle; &quot;at the Eyres', eh?</p>
<p>'The merry brown Eyres come leaping,'</p>
<p>as Kingsley has it. What a pity they haven't asked me!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're going, Prescott, I suppose?&quot; asked Kinchenton. &quot;The Eyres are friends
of yours--you're going to their fête?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I! no, Padre,&quot; was the reply; &quot;I'm not going.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, he's very bad!&quot; said Pringle, in a whisper, &quot;He's got it awfully, but
he'll get better.&quot;</p>
<br>
<div style="font-size: 8pt; margin-left: 0em">
	<p class="t1" style="text-indent: -2px">'Now he 0as turned himself wholly to
	love and follows a damsel,<br>
	Caring no more for honour, or glory, or Pallas Athené.'</div>
<br>
<p class="continue">Kingsley again--hem!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wonder, Mr. Pringle,&quot; said Mr. Dibb, &quot;that you do not attempt to form some
more permanent style of reading than the mere poetry, scraps of which you are
always quoting. For my own part, I consider poetry the flimsiest kind of writing
extant.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm surprised at that, now,&quot; said Pringle placidly. &quot;I should have thought
that you would have been a great appreciator of the gloomy and Byronic verse. To
understand that properly, you must have lost all digestive power; and you know,
Mr. Dibb, that your liver is horribly out of order.&quot;</p>
<p>A general laugh followed this remark, in which even Mr. Kinchenton joined,
and at which Mr. Dibb looked more savage than ever. In the midst of it the clock
struck two, and at the last sound Mr. Crump closed his blotting-book, put on his
hat, and vanished, saying &quot;G-good&quot; as he passed through the door; two minutes
afterwards, fragments of the word &quot;d-day&quot; were heard reverberating in the
passage. Simultaneously Mr. Boppy struck work and went to look after his dog,
Mr. Dibb started off without a word, and Mr. Prescott took off his coat to wash
his hands previous to departure. When he emerged from the washing cupboard, he
found Pringle waiting for him: both the young men shook hands with their chief,
sent their loves to Mrs. Kinchenton and the boy, and turned out into the Strand.</p>
<p>They had not gone far when Pringle asked his companion whither he was bound.
Prescott was too absorbed to hear the question, but, on its repetition, muttered
something about an &quot;engagement out Kensington way.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; said Pringle, with the nearest approach to a sigh, &quot;ride a cock horse,
eh? the old game! Look here, Jim, old fellow. I'm not clever, you know, but I
know how many blue beans make five; and I'm not strait-laced or pious or any
thing of that sort, but I'm very fond of you, and I tell you this won't do!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What won't do?&quot; asked Prescott, with a flaming face.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, this Kate Mellon business, Jim. It's on hot and strong, I know. You've
been down in the mouth all the time she was away; you met her at the station
yesterday, and probably you're going up to her place to-day. Now you know, Jim,
I've seen more of life than you, and I tell you this is all wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, you don't imagine that there's any thing--?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't imagine any thing at all. I haven't got any imagination, I think.
I'm the most matter-of-fact beggar that ever walked; but I know you're
confoundedly spooney and hard hit, and in a wrong quarter. Now, Jim, pull
yourself together, old man, and cut it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can't, George,&quot; groaned Prescott, raising his hat and tossing the hair
back from his forehead; &quot;I can't. You don't know how I love that woman, old
fellow. I'd die for her; I'd go out and be shot at once, if it would save her a
pang. I hate any one to come near her, and I'm always thinking of her, and
longing to be with her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I felt just like that once for a female tobacconist in Briggate, at Leeds,&quot;
said Mr. Pringle after a pause. &quot;Deuced nice girl she was too, and what
thundering bad cigars she sold! I'm very glad I didn't die for her, though. I
got my appointment just in time, and came up to town without asking her to fly
with me to distant climes. She wouldn't have known what 'climes' meant, I think.
Now, look here, Jim; you'd better do something of the same sort. Apply for
sick-leave (Glauber will give you a certificate), and go home and have some
shooting, and stay with your people, and you'll come back cured. Only cut it at
once. Don't go there to-day; come with me. I've got a little business to do that
won't take half an hour, and then I'm going to spar with Bob Travers, and you
shall see me polish him off with a new 'Mendoza tip' that I learnt last night.
Now, you'll come, won't you, Jim?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not to-day, George. I know you're right in every word you say; and yet I
can't give it up yet--at all events to-day. I must see her, I've got something
special to say to her, and the time's getting on. Good-by, old fellow; I know
you mean well; and I'll come out all right yet. God bless you, old boy! Hi!
Hansom!&quot; and Mr. Prescott jumped into a cab, murmured an inaudible address to
the driver, and was whirled away.</p>
<p>Mr. Pringle remained on the kerb-stone, shaking his head and looking after
the departing Hansom. &quot;James Prescott is in for it,&quot; said he to himself; &quot;is
decidedly in for it. So, by the way, is George Pringle. If I don't pay Wilkins
that twenty pounds to-night, I shall be County-Courted, as safe as houses. I
never have put my hand to any bill before; but needs must, I suppose. So I'll
just step up and see old Scadgers.&quot; And Mr. Pringle struck across the Strand, in
a northerly direction.</p>
<br>

<h4><a name="div1_11" href="#div1Ref_11">CHAPTER XI.</a></h4>
<h5>WITH THE SECRETARY.</h5>
<br>
<p>If, instead of ascending the broad staircase immediately on entering the
Tin-Tax Office, you were to proceed straight forward, you would come to the
messengers' lobby, which is the outpost, protecting the penetralia where the
Commissioners and the Secretary are enshrined. The principal duty of these
messengers, besides answering bells and carrying about official papers, was to
protect the august personages just referred to from being intruded upon by &quot;the
public;&quot; and as one learnt from his Scripture History that the term &quot;Gentiles&quot;
meant &quot;all nations except the Jews,&quot; so, after a very little official
experience, one became aware that &quot;the public&quot; meant every body who did not hold
an appointment in the Tin-Tax Office. The duties incumbent upon certain
emissaries of the Office, in regard to the collection of revenue, made the
head-quarters at Rutland House a grand resort of the &quot;public,&quot; who generally
came here with very belligerent intentions, and who either referred to printed
documents in their hands and wished to see Mr. Simnel the Secretary (whose name
appeared attached to the documents) or occasionally even demanded an interview
with the Chief Commissioner, the great Sir Hickory Maddox, himself. It is
needless to say that these wishes were never gratified: the messengers of the
Tin-Tax Office were men to whom, in the discharge of his favourite
accomplishment, Ananias could not have held a candle; men with imperturbable
faces and ready tongues, who took the &quot;public's&quot; measure in an instant, and sent
him to whatsoever clerk they thought would most readily dispose of his
grievance. &quot;I wish to see the Chief Commissioner,&quot; would exclaim a Briton, red
in face, dripping in head, and bursting with indignation. To him calm, majestic
Mr. Potts, the chief messenger, a fat man with a big forehead, a large stomach,
flat feet in low shoes, and a general butlerish appearance--&quot;Sir 'Ickry is with
the Chanclr of Schequer, sir, on most important bisness.&quot; &quot;The Secretary, then.&quot;
&quot;The Seckittary have gone with Sir 'Ickry, sir;--what is your bisness, sir?&quot;
&quot;Why, I've been overcharged--&quot; &quot;Ah, thought so, sir! Rebate on prop'ty dooty.
Walker, show the gentleman to number 15,&quot;--and away down the loud-resounding
passages, or up the mountainous stairs, would the unfortunate &quot;public&quot; be
hurried.</p>
<p>The superior rooms lay up a little passage to the right of the messengers'
lobby, and were three in number. First came the Board-room, a large and solemn
salmon-coloured apartment, where the Commissioners sat when for despatch of
business assembled. A big, dull-faced clock ticked on the mantelshelf; solemn
green maps of distant countries, from year's end to year's end undisturbed,
curled themselves round in dusty layers on the walls; and a large red-leather
sofa, on which Mr. Beresford, in the absence of the other Commissioners, and
after a hard night's waltzing, had enjoyed hours of pleasant repose, filled up a
recess. In the centre of the room stood a heavy writing-table, with pads of
blotting-paper, pools of black ink, and bundles of quill-pens distributed at
regular intervals. At the head of this table always stood a red-leather
arm-chair, and this arm-chair always on business occasions contained the sacred
person of the Chief Commissioner, Sir Hickory Maddox. A little man, Sir Hickory,
with a parchment face, a blue eye like a bit out of a china plate, stiff gray
hair brushed into a point on the top of his head, and formal little gray
whiskers: always dressed in a little black frock-coat, and little gray waistcoat
and trousers; wearing too a heavy gold-set cornelian seal, and a cumbrous
old-fashioned watch-key, just projecting from his fob,--buoys to show
whereabouts his thick gold chronometer was sunk, in some unknown depths. A
kind-hearted, fussy, hard-working man, whose family had been for generations in
the public service, who had himself worked for years in the Draft and Docket
Office, had risen and distinguished himself there, and had finally been rewarded
with the Chief-Commissionership of the Tin-Tax, and with being created a K.C.B.
His official position he esteemed one of the most enviable in the kingdom; he
thought of nothing but official matters; and when, being of a hospitable turn,
he had solemn dinners at his house in Wimpole Street, all the guests were
magnates of other offices or--for he was a kind chief in that respect--juniors
of the Tin-Tax. And invariably, just as the cloth was drawn, the butler would
appear at his master's elbow, bearing a salver, on which lay an enormous
red-leather official despatch-pouch. The little man would smile feebly at his
guests, would shrug his shoulders, and saying, &quot;Our labours follow us even
here,&quot; would unlock the pouch, glance at its contents (probably the <i>Globe</i>,
and private note), and relocking it, say, &quot;Lay it on the library-table, Benson.
I must go into the matter before I sleep. However, <i>nunc vino pellite curas!</i>
Port, sherry, madeira, and claret!&quot;</p>
<p>Between Sir Hickory Maddox the senior, and Mr. Beresford the junior, there
were two other Commissioners. One was the Honourable Morris Peck, who had been a
Gentleman Usher at Court,--at whose name years ago young ladies used to blush,
and matrons to gather themselves together in brood-hen fashion for the
protection of their chicks,--a roysterer at Crockford's, a friend of Pea-Green
Payne and the Golden Hall and that lot,--a &quot;devil of a fellow, sir!&quot; but who was
now merely a hook-nosed old gentleman in a high coat-collar and a curly-brimmed
hat; wearing false teeth, dyed hair, and blacked eyebrows; who always slept
peacefully until his signature was required, when he gave it in a very shaky
schoolboy scrawl. The other was Mr. Miles O'Scardon, an Irish gentleman of
ancient family, but limited means, who had represented Ballyhogue in Parliament
for years, and who had obtained his appointment for the fidelity with which he
had always obeyed the summons of the ministerial whip. Beyond the Board-room lay
the sanctum of the Chief-Commissioner's private secretary, a young man always
chosen for his good looks, his good clothes, and his gentlemanly bearing, who
was envied by his brother juniors, but who had to answer Sir Hickory's bell, and
was consequently taunted by the epithet &quot;Jeames.&quot; And beyond that, though
unconnected with it, lay the Secretary's room.</p>
<p>A large, light, airy room, far away from the noise and bustle, and looking on
to the river. Round the walls are huge oak-presses, filled with tied-up bundles
of confidential papers, secret reports of the out-door agents of the Tin-Tax
Office, which, if published, would have astonished the world by throwing quite a
new light on the incomes of several of its idols. Maps were there too, and
framed tables of statistics, and the Stationers' Almanac; and over the
mantelpiece hung a proof-before-letters engraving of the portrait of Sir Hickory
Maddox, after Grant, with an exact likeness of that great official's favourite
inkstand and quill-pen, and with a correctness in the fit of the trousers such
as was never achieved by the great original. There was a round table in the
middle of the room, divided into two equal portions by a line of books of
reference--Guide-books, M'Culloch's Commercial Dictionary, Haydn's Dates, the
Post-Office Directory, Bradshaw, and other light reading: one side of the line
of demarcation was bare (save at one o'clock, when it bore the little tray
containing the Secretary's light luncheon); on the other lay the Secretary's
blotting-book, pen-stand, and paper-case.</p>
<p>About the time when the conversation recorded in the last chapter was going
on between his clerks, Mr. Simnel, the Secretary, sat in his official room,
signing his name to printed papers, which he took one by one from a large heap
at his right hand, and, after signing, dropped at his feet. It was plain that
his thoughts were otherwise absorbed; for as the sheets fell from his hand and
fluttered to the ground, he never looked after them, but would occasionally
pause in his occupation, lay down his pen, nurse his right leg with both hands,
and rock himself quietly to and fro. As he moved here and there in the sunlight,
you might have perceived that his limbs were long and ungainly; that he had big
broad hands with thick corrugated veins, and finger-nails strong, hard, and cut
to a point; that he was very bald, and that such fringe of hair as remained was
of a dull red; that he had a large sensual face, big projecting brown eyes,
thick clumsy nose, full scarlet underlip, heavy jowl, and large massive chin.
You could have noticed, too, that, in certain lights, this face was worn and
jaded and almost haggard, traversed here and there with deep furrowed lines,
marked with crow's-feet and wrinkles and deep indentations. As you gazed,
perhaps, all this faded away, the face beamed forth happy, jolly, sensual as
ever; but you felt that the wrinkles were there, and that so soon as the flicker
passed away, they would be seen again.</p>
<p>Not in the discharge of his easy labours at the Tin-Tax Office had Mr. Simnel
acquired these lines and wrinkles. The calm direction of that engine of the
State had only come upon him of late years, and never had caused him any
trouble. But Mr. Simnel had compressed a great many years' experience into forty
years of life, and the crow's-feet and indentations were the result of
brain-labour, worry, and anxiety. Mr. Simnel's first recollection of any thing
found him a little boy, in a skeleton-suit, at the grammar-school of
Combcardingham,--a city which every body save the envious inhabitants of its
rival Dockborough allowed to be the metropolis of the north. Little Bob Simnel
did not know whose son he was, or how his schooling was paid for; all he knew
was, that he boarded with an old lady, the widow of a tax-collector, who was
very kind to him, and that he soon found out the best thing he could do was to
stick to his book. To his book he stuck manfully; walked through all the classes
of the grammar-school, one by one, until he became junior boy of the sixth form,
until he became senior boy of the sixth form, until the visiting examiner, the
Bishop of Latakia, New Zealand, declared that he had the greatest pleasure in
naming Mr. Robert Simnel as the gainer of the exhibition of seventy-five pounds
a year; and added, as he shook hands with said Robert, that whichever University
he might prefer would be honoured by his choice. Young Mr. Simnel, however, did
not go to either Oxford or Cambridge: after a lengthened interview with the
head-master, the Rev. Dr. Barker, Mr. Simnel gracefully resigned the exhibition
in favour of Swetter, <i>major</i>, who &quot;proxime accessit,&quot; and entered as the
articled clerk of Messrs. Banner and Blair, accounted the sharpest lawyers in
Combcardingham, and known through all the county as great electioneering agents
for the Liberal party. A few years passed on; Mr. Simnel had finished his
articles had become the junior partner of Messrs. Banner and Blair, and was
working steadily and well, when an event happened which insured his success for
life.</p>
<p>It was this: Combcardingham, for the three last general elections, had
returned the same two members--Sir Thomas Prodd and Mr. Shuttler; both local
magnates, employing hundreds of hands, supporting local charities, known
throughout the county, and Liberal to the backbone. One morning news sped to
London that Mr. Shuttler was dead; and that evening a tall, thin gentleman, with
a hare-lip, arrived by afternoon express in Combcardingham, and engaged the
Waterloo Hotel as the head-quarters of Mr. Farquhar, the Conservative candidate.
Blue bills on a dead-wall unpleasantly proclaimed this fact to M. Simnel as he
was shaving himself the next morning; and he perceived that young Woofham, the
hope of the Liberal party, would not be brought in without a struggle. So he,
metaphorically, took off his coat and set to work; canvassed, intrigued,
cajoled, went through all the dirty round of electioneering tactics, but found
he did not make much way; found, in truth, that the hare-lipped man seemed to
have Fortunatus's purse somewhere about him, and that young Woofham was a
miserly young hunks, who did not see the borough as a proper investment for his
ingots. What was to be done? To lose the borough would be a tremendous blow to
the Government, who had always looked upon it as their own, and to whom it was
always supposed to owe allegiance. But the money? The night before the
nomination, Mr. Simnel, with his face muffled in a huge handkerchief, despatched
the following telegraphic message to Mr. Weal, the Government whip, at the
Retrenchment Club: &quot;No. 104 is putting on the steam at Combcardingham. If No.
102 does not do likewise, up goes the sponge.&quot; While No. 102 Mall-Pall is the
Retrenchment Club, No. 104 is, it is needless to say, the No Surrender
(familiarly known as the Wig and Whiskers), the head-quarters of the
Conservative party. By the early morning express a messenger, with a letter from
Mr. Weal, arrived at Mr. Simnel's office, and during the day the doubts under
which many of the electors suffered were satisfactorily explained away, and at
the close of the poll Mr. Woofham's name stood well ahead of his rival. Mr. Weal
and his party did not forget their telegraphing friend at Combcardingham. After
the election was over, Mr. Simnel was summoned to London, had an interview with
certain of the <i>Dii majors</i>, and at the end of six months was inducted into
the Secretaryship of the Tin-Tax Office, then vacant.</p>
<p>They did not like him at first at the Tin-Tax; they thought Bingham ought to
have succeeded to the berth; and Bingham--who was a very gouty old gentleman,
who took a great deal of snuff, and swore a great deal, and kept a
pocket-dictionary in the right-hand top-drawer of his desk wherewith to correct
his orthography--thought so too. But Sir Hickory Maddox, who was not merely very
popular, but very much respected by his men, showed such thorough appreciation
of Mr. Simnel's talents, and so thoroughly endorsed all the Secretary's acts,
that the men began to waver in their allegiance to the Bingham faction; to think
that Bingham was little better than an old idiot; that &quot;new blood&quot; in the
secretariat might probably not only improve the status of the Tin-Tax Office,
but get a new and improved scale for the clerks; and when they found that, after
a couple of years, the new Secretary actually did accomplish this feat, the new
Secretary was popular for ever. Popular officially, not privately. The juniors
at the Tin-Tax had been in the habit of chaffing their late lamented secretary;
of bribing him, by gifts of game and hothouse fruits, to grant them odd days and
even weeks of leave of absence; of chatting with him familiarly on current
events. Mr. Simnel's manners effectually checked all that kind of thing. With
the Commissioners he might unbend; with the juniors he was adamant. But if he
met one of his men in society, in the Opera lobby, or at a Botanical Fête, he
would make a point of shaking hands with him as though they hadn't seen each
other for ages, and of talking with him of every subject possible--except the
Tin-Tax Office.</p>
<p>The pile of papers for signature had melted to one solitary document, the
floor was strewn with the evidences of Mr. Simnel's handiwork, and Mr. Simnel
himself sat nursing his leg and swaying himself gently to and fro in meditation.
Occasionally he would pass his disengaged hand through his fringe of hair, and
smile quietly to himself, then make a few figures on his blotting-pad, add them,
and set-to rocking again. In the midst of this occupation he heard his door
open, and looking up, saw Mr. Beresford.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, what the deuce does this mean?&quot; he exclaimed, in surprise. &quot;I thought
you were on Tom Tiddler's ground, picking up unlimited gold and silver, wooing
heiresses, and settling a Belgravian ménage; and you turn up in this dingy old
barrack. Is it all over?--has the lady succumbed? and do you want me to help you
to choose fire-irons and window-curtains?&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Beresford did not reply for a minute; then he said, shortly and
decisively, &quot;I've been sold!&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Simnel gave one short, loud whistle, and said interrogatively,
&quot;Wouldn't?&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Beresford, seating himself on the edge of the table, looked up at Mr.
Simnel, who had taken up his position on the rug, with his back to the empty
fireplace, and said, &quot;No chance; booked beforehand!&quot;</p>
<p>Whereupon Mr. Simnel gave a louder whistle, and said, &quot;Tell!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You know how I stand, Simnel, well enough,&quot; said Mr. Beresford; &quot;and this
looked a very safe <i>coup</i>, I thought, specially after I got your telegram.
There were two or three fellows staying down at Bissett who I thought were on,
too. Man named Lyster; do you know him?--tall man, dark beard, yaw-haw beast,
from Indian army.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know him!&quot; was all Mr. Simnel's reply to this flattering sketch.</p>
<p>&quot;And another man, newspaper man, belongs to the 'Retrenchment' and the
'Fly-by-night;' Churchill, you know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<i>I</i> know Churchill. Was he going in for an heiress?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, not exactly; at least I thought so, but it turned out not. But I didn't
like these fellows hanging about; specially Lyster--romantic party, sigh and
that sort of business. So, when I found from you it was all right, I made up my
mind to see where I was.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well; and Miss Townshend wouldn't have it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not at all! We were sitting after dinner, when the women had gone to the
drawing-room, the very day I got your telegram, and old Wentworth told us there
was a man coming down the next day,--Schrötter, or Schröder, a German merchant
in Mincing Lane--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know him,&quot; interrupted Simnel: &quot;Gustav Schröder; elderly man. What took
him to Bissett?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Love, sir--love! he's engaged to be married to Miss Townshend!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Whew!&quot; said Mr. Simnel, with his longest and shrillest whistle. &quot;The deuce
he is! That <i>is</i> news! How does the young lady like it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, not much. She couldn't, of course, be expected to feel very
enthusiastic about a short, stout, gray-headed German, who talks the most
infernal jargon, and hasn't got a sound tooth in his head. Took him out shooting
once, but he made the most awful mess of it; devilish near shot the beaters, and
sprained his ankle leaping a half-foot ditch. The girl seemed horribly ashamed
of him, and of his clumsy compliments and elephantine gambols; but she's
evidently booked--her father takes care of that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, ha!&quot; said Mr. Simnel, nursing his knee, rocking himself to and fro, and
rapidly going off into an absent fit; &quot;ah, ha!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I hate to hear you say 'ah, ha,' Simnel!&quot; said Mr. Beresford, with some
asperity. &quot;You're always up to some plottings and plans when you utter those
seemingly benevolent grunts. I suppose you suspect old Townshend of some grand
<i>diablerie</i> in this affair. I never could make out what it is that you know
about that old gentleman.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Know about him?&quot; said Simnel, rousing himself with a laugh; &quot;that he gives
capital dinners and has plenty of money; that he's about to marry his daughter
to one of the richest men in the City. What more need one know about a man? I
don't know what church he goes to, or what peculiar shade of religion he
affects; whether he's a good father or a bad one; whether he rules his daughter,
or is ruled by her. But I <i>do</i> know that he drinks Tod-Heatly's champagne,
and banks at the London and Westminster. This news looks fishy for your
business, Beresford!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Simply a case of stump,&quot; said Mr. Beresford, rising from the table, plunging
his hands into his trousers-pockets, and striding up and down the room.</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean to do?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Borrow two hundred pounds more of you,&quot; exclaimed Beresford, stopping short
on the edge of the rug, and confronting Mr. Simnel.</p>
<p>&quot;And then?&quot; asked the latter gentleman, smiling calmly.</p>
<p>&quot;God knows!&quot; said Beresford, with something like a shudder. &quot;Something must
turn up; the Bishop must die or Lady Lowndes, and there'd be a safe something
from them; or there'll be some girl--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ye-es,&quot; interrupted Mr. Simnel drily, seating himself at his desk, and
unlocking a draw therein. &quot;You're the most marvellously sanguine fellow,
perfectly Micawberish in your notions of something turning up, and your making a
<i>coup</i>. But--suppose t'other! suppose it didn't come off! Now you owe
me,&quot;--looking at a paper which he took from the drawer,--&quot;six hundred pounds
already, and I've only got insurance policies for security.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You get your interest,&quot; growled Beresford.</p>
<p>&quot;A mild six;&quot; said Mr. Simnel, with a shrug of his shoulders and his pleasant
smile. &quot;A mild six; just what I should get in Bombay Preference, or Great
Luxembourg Centrals, or a dozen other safe investments. However, you shall have
this two hundred; but I should be glad to see your way in the future. Is there
no girl with money whom you think you could propose to speedily?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not one,&quot; said Beresford, stopping in his walk and reseating himself on the
table. &quot;Oh, by Jove, I forgot to tell you that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;About Kate Mellon,--tremendous scene just before I left;&quot; and Mr. Beresford
proceeded to recount the dialogue between him and Kate Mellon, which was
recorded in the fourth chapter of this story. He told the tale honestly
throughout, and when he had finished he looked up in Mr. Simnel's face, and
said, &quot;Deuced awkward position, wasn't it?&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Simnel had not lost one word of the story; on the contrary, he had
listened to it with the greatest eagerness and interest, but he did not answer
Mr. Beresford's final query. He had fallen into his old, leg-nursing attitude,
and was rocking himself silently to and fro.</p>
<p>&quot;Devilish unpleasant, wasn't it?&quot; reiterated Mr. Beresford.</p>
<p>&quot;Eh!&quot; said Mr. Simnel in a loud high key. &quot;Yes, most unpleasant, of course.
We'll talk more about that; but you must be off now. To-day's only half a day,
you know; and I've got all sorts of things to do before I go. You shall have
that two hundred on Monday, all right. Good-by! see you on Monday,&quot; and the
Secretary shook hands with the Commissioner until the latter was fairly outside
the door.</p>
<p>Then Mr. Simnel returned to his desk, and took up his leg again.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems to be coming on now,&quot; he said to himself, &quot;and all together too.
The old man always meant little Alice for a Duke, and now to let her go to such
carrion as old Schröder; that looks like smash. He holds heavily in Pernambucos,
in Cotopaxis, and other stuff that's run down like water lately; and he must
have dropped at least ten thousand in that blessed Bird-in-the-Hand insurance. I
think the time has come to put the screw on, and I don't think&quot;--turning to a
drawer and taking from an envelope a paper yellow with age--&quot;that he'll
dishonour this. What an awful time ago it seems! There,&quot;--replacing the
paper,--&quot;go back till you're wanted. You've kept so long that--Ah, by Jove! the
other business! To be married, eh? To be married, Kate?&quot; releasing his leg and
plucking at his lips. &quot;To be married to Master Charley Beresford! not while I
live, my child! not while I live, and have power to turn a screw on in your
direction too!&quot;</p>

<h5>WHERE MR. PRINGLE WENT TO.</h5>
<br>
<p>It has been notified in a previous chapter that Mr. Pringle was in some
mental anxiety touching the acquisition of a certain twenty pounds which he
required for immediate disbursement. This position he held in common with many
of his colleagues at the Tin-Tax Office, and indeed with most junior clerks in
the Civil Service. &quot;The truth is,&quot; says Captain Smoke, in Douglas Jerrold's
comedy, <i>The Bubbles of the Day</i>, &quot;I want a thousand pounds.&quot; &quot;My dear
Smoke,&quot; says his friend, &quot;there never was a man yet that did <i>not</i> want a
thousand pounds.&quot; The truth of the axiom is undeniable; only in the Civil
Service the amount is much diminished. Twenty pounds, familiarly known as a
&quot;twentyer,&quot; is generally the much-desiderated sum among the junior slaves of the
Crown; and it was for a &quot;twentyer&quot; that Mr. Pringle now pined. A hosier who some
two years before had sued for Mr. Pringle's custom, nor sued in vain,--who had
supplied him with under-linen of fine texture and high price, with shirts of
brilliant and variegated patterns, with boating jerseys and socks so vivid in
stripe that his legs resembled those of the functionary in the opening of the
pantomime who by the boys in the gallery is prematurely recognised as the future
clown, owing to the resplendent beauty of his ankles,--at length, after repeated
transmissions of his &quot;little account,&quot; and after mystic hints that he had not
yet seen the colour of Mr. Pringle's money, brought into action the terrible
engines of the law, and summoned his debtor to the County Court.</p>
<p>It was at the very latter end of the quarter when this legal ukase was placed
in Mr. Pringle's hands, and that gentleman, examining his capital, found it
consist of thirty-seven shillings, a silver threepence, and a penny,--which sums
were to provide his dinners, cigars, and general pleasures for a fortnight.
Clearly, then, out of this no compromise could be effected; he could not even go
through that performance so dear to the hard-pressed debtor, which is
temporarily so soothing and in the end so futile, known as paying &quot;something on
account.&quot; A five-pound note has the same effect on a tradesman to whom twenty
pounds are owing as a wet brush on a very bad hat,--it creates a temporary gleam
of comfort, <i>but nothing more</i>. Mr. Pringle had not even this resource: if
he were summoned to the County Court, and if the investigation were reported, as
it was sure to be, in <i>The Dalston Dreadnought and De Beauvoir Town Looker-on</i>,
he should get horribly chaffed by his comrades, perhaps pitched into by the
Board, and it would bring all his other creditors down on him. So something must
be done, and cash must be raised at once. Mr. Pringle did not know where to
turn: he had never been a borrower, and hated the idea of asking money favours
from his friends; moreover, in real truth, he would not have known whom to turn
to, had he been so minded. Prescott, his Pylades, was by no means overburdened
with money--indeed, Kinchenton's income only sufficed for the keeping up of his
modest establishment and for the schooling of Percy; while Dibb, Crump, Boppy,
or any of the other office men, were utterly impracticable in such a case.
Finally, he determined that he must &quot;do a bill;&quot; an act of which he had hitherto
been innocent, and towards the proper accomplishment of which he thought it best
to take the advice of Mr. Rittman.</p>
<p>In nearly every Government office there is one impecunious black sheep,--one
clerk who is always hovering on the edge of the precipice of insolvency, over
which he finally tumbles, to creep out with life indeed, but with scars and
bruises which last him during the remainder of his official existence. This
character was in the Tin-Tax Office played by Mr. Rittman, who for years had
been &quot;in difficulties,&quot; and was thoroughly versed in every species of
money-borrowing, were it the loan-simple from a friend, the loan-complex on a
bill with a friend's name, the life-insurance facile, the loan-office ruinous,
the bill of sale advertised, or the pawnbroker low. As yet no learned
Commissioner had sat in judgment on Mr. Rittman's pecuniary transactions, but he
had been in sponging-houses, in Whitecross Street, and in the Queen's Bench; and
though his end was rapidly approaching (for he had a couple of sons verging on
manhood, and apparently inheriting all their father's frailties), he was never
despondent, but maintained a creditable appearance and a cheerful manner. To him
Mr. Pringle had gone, on the day before that on which we first made his
acquaintance; and Mr. Rittman, from the young man's manner on entering the room,
at once guessed the object of his visit.</p>
<p>&quot;How do, Rittman?&quot; commenced Mr. Pringle.</p>
<p>&quot;Good morning, my dear sir--good morning!&quot; said the gentleman addressed,
laying down his pen and bowing pleasantly. He had on a voluminous white
waistcoat, a great show of shirt-wristband, and before him, in a tumbler, stood
some choice flowers. &quot;Seldom you come down to this part of the building; keep to
the more aristocratic end--eh?&quot; and Mr. Rittman smiled, and showed a good set of
teeth.</p>
<p>&quot;No! I don't know--the truth is--I want some advice, and I think you're the
man to give it to me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My dear sir, I shall be delighted. What is it?&quot; (this thrown off at a
tangent to a messenger who appeared in the doorway, saying, &quot;Ere's Brown's man
agen, Mr. Rittman&quot;). &quot;Ah! Brown's man; well, you'd better say I've not yet
returned from Jersey, but you expect me on Tuesday.--And now, my dear sir; you
were saying--some advice?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, the fact is, Rittman, I'm hard up, and I want to borrow some money;
and I thought you could--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not lend you any? that would be almost too delicious, my dear sir. You
didn't think I could lend you any?&quot; and Mr. Rittman screamed with laughter at
the absurdity of the idea.</p>
<p>&quot;No, no, of course not; but I thought you might tell me where I could get
it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, that's a totally different thing; of course I can. I rather pique myself
upon knowing more about such matters than most men. Of course I can. Now, let me
see--what security can you give?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Eh?&quot; asked Mr. Pringle.</p>
<p>&quot;Security for the repayment? If you borrow from the Rainy. Day or Amicable
Nest-Eggs Insurance Office, you must give two sureties, householders, and insure
for double the amount of the loan. If you go to the Helping Hand or the Leg-up
Loan Office, you must give three sureties, householders, and pay a lot for
office-fees and inquiries, which are made by a dirty-faced man at a pound a
week. If you give a bill of sale on your furniture--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My good sir,&quot; said Pringle testily, &quot;I've got no furniture. And surely all
this bother can't be necessary for the sum I want--only twenty pounds.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Twenty pounds! twenty pounds! a fleabite, a mere fleabite!&quot; said Mr. Rittman
(he had three and sevenpence in his pocket at the moment, and did not know in
the least where to turn for more). &quot;I hoped you were going to call my
generalship into play; for I may say, without boasting, that when it's not for
myself, I am fertile in resources. But--twenty pounds--I'll give you the address
of a man who'll let you have it at once.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There won't be any names wanted, or any thing of that sort, will there?&quot;
asked Pringle, rather doubtful of this promptitude.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing of the kind; merely your acknowledgment. Here's the
address--Scadgers, Newman Street. You'll find Mr. Scadgers a curious man, but
very pleasant; and when you say you come from me, he'll be very polite. And, Mr.
Pringle, let me give you one word of advice--Be firm in the matter of Madeira.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In the matter of Madeira?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, awful; you can't stand it. Ostades are bad enough, or a Stradivarius
fiddle; and perhaps, as you're a single man in apartments, a key-bugle mightn't
do, as likely to be objected to by the other lodgers--but any of them rather
than the Madeira.&quot;</p>
<p>In the middle of Newman Street stands a paintless door, in the centre of
which gleams a brass-plate, bearing the word &quot;Scadgers,&quot; in fat Roman capitals.
Nothing else. No &quot;Mr.;&quot; no description of Scadgers' profession; nothing to break
the charm. &quot;Scadgers&quot; stands an oasis of shining brass in a desert of lustreless
deal, and winks knowingly at the double-faced portrait, one half dirty, the
other half clean, at the picture-restorer's over the way. Scadgers' door
differed from its fellows in having but one bell-handle; for Scadgers had quite
enough business to occupy the whole house, and to demand ramifications in the
neighbourhood. All we have to do, in the course of this story, is to deal with
Scadgers as Scadgers; but my private belief is that Scadgers was the Universal
Philanthropic Man's a Man for a' that Loan Office, held at the Blue Pig and
Toothache in Wells Street; that he was &quot;Cash promptly advanced on furniture
without removal, freehold and leasehold property, legacies, reversions,
warrants, and all other securities. Sheriffs' executions and rent-distraint
immediately paid out&quot; (<i>vide</i> advertisement);--that he was &quot;Methuselah's
Muffin-Powder, or Never say Die&quot; patent medicine, and proprietor-in-chief of
&quot;The Hob,&quot; a domestic Miscellany, which commenced with weak romance, and failed,
but has since achieved an enormous success for itself, and a fortune for its
spirited proprietor, by the publication of &quot;Baby Clarence; or, My Life at
Brompton.&quot; Certainly you could not have guessed Scadgers' occupation from the
outside of his residence, which looked like a dirty lodging-house, like a
third-rate boarding-house, like those melancholy houses occupied by those most
melancholy people on earth, third-rate piano-sellers; like a house let in rooms
to people who lithograph fashion-plates; like any thing but what it was--a house
where more money was made than in nine-tenths of the houses in London.</p>
<p>When Mr. Pringle arrived on the Scadgerian steps, he looked for a knocker,
and finding none, he pulled the Scadgerian bell. A responsive click and the
partial unlatching of the door invited him to push; the door yielded, and he
found himself in a large and empty hall, on one side of which was a glass door,
with the word &quot;Office&quot; in faded gilt letters on a white ground. This glass-door
being open, Mr. Pringle walked straight through, and found himself in the
&quot;office.&quot; He had seen a good many offices in his time, but never one like this.
He had never seen an office with musical instruments in it before; and here were
four or five pianos standing ranged against the wall, to say nothing of harps in
leather cases leaning drunkenly in corners, and a few cornets-à-piston in green
boxes, and a guitar or two with blue ribbons to hang them round your neck by,
just as if they had come fresh from the necks of Spanish <i>donnas</i>. And
there were slack-baked-looking old pictures in heavy Dutch-metal frames--fine
specimens of old masters--saints with skulls and Bibles in front of them, and
very ascetic cheek-bones and great phrenological development of talent and
courage; Dutch boors standing on one leg and drinking glasses of ale, and
yawning youths with an effect of shaded candlelight on their faces. There were
modern pictures, too, of lakes and Thames scenery, and girls with fair hair,
which, when compared with the old ones, looked as if they had been painted in
milk-and-water; and there were three driving-whips in one corner, a set of
harness across a chair, and the leather cushions of a brougham under it. There
was a bronze umbrella-stand, formed by a dog holding a whip in his mouth, a big
French clock, and a couple of chemist's bottles, red and green; and in the midst
of all this confusion stood a little shrivelled old man, with very white hair
and a very red face--a dirty little old man dressed in a rusty suit of black,
who addressed Mr. Pringle in a rusty creaking voice, and wanted to know &quot;his
pleasure.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I--I wish to speak to Mr. Scadgers,&quot; said Mr. Pringle, with a modesty and
hesitation altogether strange to him.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; said the little old man; &quot;deary me! yes!&quot; and then he seated himself on
the edge of a wine-hamper, and began to count his fingers with great interest,
as though not quite sure of the number he really possessed.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Scadgers!&quot; said Pringle, after a minute or two.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, yes! I'll call him,&quot; said the little old man, and rang a bell which
lurked in the corner of the chimney-piece.</p>
<p>A great creaking of uncarpeted stairs under heavy boots followed this
bell-ringing, and presently Mr. Scadgers entered the room. Mr. Scadgers'
appearance partook of the charming amenities of the prize-fighter and the
undertaker: his hair was black and close-cropped, his face white, his nose red,
one eye was considerably larger than the other, and one corner of his mouth had
a peculiar upward twist. He was dressed in black, with a pair of dull leather
boots reaching half-way up his thighs; and as he came through the door, he took
a red silk pocket-handkerchief from the crown of his hat, and mopped his head.</p>
<p>&quot;Servant, sir!&quot; said Mr. Scadgers, surveying Mr. Pringle with his gleaming
black eyes, and reckoning him up in a moment. &quot;What may you want?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Mr. Pringle, &quot;I wanted a few minutes' conversation; but private,
if you please--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; interrupted Mr. Scadgers, &quot;don't mind Jinks; he's safe enough--knows
all my affairs--thoroughly to be trusted.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, then,&quot; said Mr. Pringle, hesitating; then, with a desperate rush,
&quot;look here!--fact is--want money!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; said Mr. Scadgers, with something like admiration in his tone, &quot;got it
out with a rush, didn't you? That's the only way! Who told you to come to me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Rittman, of the--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know--Tin-tax Office. Do you belong to it? Thought so. Wretched office;
lost a mint of money in that office. What salary do you get?&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Pringle mentioned that he was in the receipt of ninety pounds a-year.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! twenty-one eighteen and nine on the 5th of every third month--I know all
about it! Now&quot; mopping his head, &quot;how much do you want?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Twenty pounds.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Lor' bless me! and when do you want it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;At once!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Can't be done, sir! can't be done!&quot; Violent mopping. &quot;Haven't got any money
in the house. Can't you look in next week, and I might let you have ten?&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Pringle roundly asserted that this would not do at all, and turned round
towards the door.</p>
<p>&quot;Stop, sir!&quot; shouted Mr. Scadgers, making tremendous play with the red-silk
handkerchief. &quot;What a hasty young man you are! Look here,&quot;--taking out his
purse,--&quot;here's a ten-pound note that I promised to young Stephens of the Wafer
Office; he was to have been here by two; now its getting on for three, and he's
not come. I might let you have that!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But that's only ten!&quot; said Mr. Pringle.</p>
<p>&quot;<i>Only</i> ten! what a way to speak of money! Wait, sir, wait; let us see
what we can do. Any one likely to look in this afternoon to pay any interest,
Jinks?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Too late now!&quot; said Jinks, with brevity.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! too late--I dessay! Just look in the cash-box, Jinks, and see what's
there; though I'm afraid it's not much. I should say there wasn't more than
three pounds, Jinks!&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Jinks peered into a little cash-box on the desk before him, and answered,
&quot;Just three pound!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! bring 'em out, Jinks; give 'em here. Let's see--ten and three's
thirteen; and that only leaves me seven-and-six to go on with till Monday! Never
mind: you could have thirteen, Mr.--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I want twenty!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, so you do! Pity you don't want some wine! I've got some Madeiry as
would--but wine ain't money, is it? There's a splendid picture, now--a Murillo:
you might take that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pictures are not more money than wine; are they?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ain't they? That Murillo's worth ten pound, and any one would give you that
for it. Ain't there no one you could sell it to? You see you're in such a hurry
for the money, or you might offer it to the National Gallery, or some swell
collecting of pictures might buy it, but you're so pressed. Tell you what you
might do, though,&quot; said Mr. Scadgers, as though struck by a sudden inspiration:
&quot;you might pawn it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How the deuce could I go lugging that picture about the streets to pawn it?&quot;
said Pringle testily.</p>
<p>&quot;No, to be sure! Stay, look here! I dare say Jinks wouldn't mind pawning it
for you. Jinks, look here; just run with this round the corner, will you? Get as
much as you can, you know.&quot; And without more ado, Mr. Jinks put on a
reddish-black napless hat, tucked the picture under his arm, and started off.</p>
<p>While he was gone, Mr. Scadgers asked Mr. Pringle what his name was, how long
he had been in the office, where he lodged, and other home-thrusting questions;
and presently Mr. Jinks returned without the picture, but with three sovereigns
and a printed ticket, which he delivered to his master, saying, &quot;Wouldn't do no
more than three.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Three!&quot; said Mr. Scadgers. &quot;Well, that's nearer to twenty than we was, isn't
it? Now, Mr. Pringle,&quot;--taking a slip of stamped paper from his
pocketbook--&quot;just you sign your name at the bottom here. All correct, you see.
Fifth of next month,--promise to pay,--value received,--and all the rest of it;
and I'll hand you over sixteen pounds and the ticket; and when you get that
picture out, you'll have a treasure.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, curse the picture!&quot; said Pringle ruefully.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah,&quot; said Mr. Scadgers, grinning, &quot;that's what they all says. Cuss the
picture! Well, if that ticket ain't any use to you, I don't mind giving you half
a pound for it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I thought you had only seven-and-sixpence left?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No more I have, myself; but I might borrow half a pound from Jinks. What do
you say? Ah, I thought so. Here, Jinks, put this little dockyment along with
your other valuables. Here's the half pound, sir. Now let's look at your
signature. George Townshend Pringle! Very nice. No relation to Mr. Townshend, of
Austin Friars--the great Townshend?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He's my uncle,&quot; said Pringle. &quot;I'm named after him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Indeed! named after him A very capital connexion. Good morning, sir! good
morning! I'll look in upon you on the fifth.&quot;</p>
<p>But after Mr. Pringle had gone, Mr. Scadgers still stood with the bill
fluttering between his fingers, muttering to himself: &quot;Sing'ler that! very
sing'ler! For years I hadn't seen the Runner until yesterday, when I came across
him in Cheapside; and now to-day I hear of him again. I wonder,&quot; added Mr.
Scadgers, with a very sinister smile, &quot;whether that little account between me
and the Runner will ever be wound up? I've owed him one this many a year.&quot;</p>

<h4><a name="div1_13" href="#div1Ref_13">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h4>
<h5>MR. PRESCOTT'S PROCEEDINGS.</h5>
<br>
<p>The Hansom cab conveying Mr. Prescott went at a rapid pace along the Strand,
through the Pall-Mall district, and by divers short cuts into Piccadilly. There
was nothing to stop it; there were no blocks or stoppages; and as it was the
dead season of the year, and every one was out of town, the Commissioners of
Sewers were good enough to leave the roads alone; reserving until the traffic
was in full play their right to erect gigantic, hideous hoardings in the most
crowded thoroughfares. The streets were deserted, the public buildings shut up,
dust and straw and dirty paper whirled about in the eddying gusts of the
autumnal wind, and the entire appearance of London was dull and wretched. People
had evidently been in doubt what to do about dress; and while some were in the
faded gaiety of the just-departed summer, others were putting on an even shadier
appearance in the creased and awkward garments of the previous winter. The
doctors' carriages and the hack-cabs had the thoroughfares to themselves; the
occupants of the former, always on the watch for the recognition of some
favoured patient, sat back in their vehicles, engaged either in the perusal of
some medical work, or in happy day-dreams of increased practice, studs of
wearied horses, noble introductions, enormous fees,--all culminating, perhaps,
in baronetcies and appointments at Court.</p>
<p>Of the hack-cabs seen about, but few were Hansoms; for at that season men who
want to go quickly, and don't mind paying a shilling a mile, are at a discount.
Now and then a sun-tanned swell, whose portmanteau atop nearly obstructed the
driver's sight, and who himself was but dimly visible among gun-cases,
hat-boxes, and railway-rugs, might have been encountered, passing from one
terminus to another; but the &quot;reg'lar riders,&quot;--the lawyer's clerk, with the
tape-tied bundle of papers, who charges his cab to &quot;the office;&quot; the lounging
swell; the M.P. dashing down to the House; the smug-faced capitalist, whose
brain is full of calculation, and who sits the whole way to the City smiling at
all and seeing none; the impecunious speculator, who rides in a cab because he
cannot afford to be seen in an omnibus,--all these were away from London. And
the four-wheelers, though laden, had but dreary burdens: the fortnight at
Margate is over; no more morning dips, no more afternoon rambles on the sands,
no donkey-backs, no pleasure-boats, no Pegwell Bay now! Paterfamilias is once
more Hobbs and Motchkin's out-door at thirty shillings a week; the eight-roomed
house in Navarino Terrace, Camden Town, resumes its wonted appearance; the
children return to the &quot;curriculum&quot; of education at Miss Gimp's in the Crescent;
and save the sand-covered little wooden spades which hang from the hat-pegs in
the passage, naught remains of their maritime excursion.</p>
<p>Dreary, dreary, every where! Dreary down in old country mansions, where,
while the men are pheasant-shooting in the woods, the ladies look dismally on
what was lately the croquet-ground, where the gardeners are now busy sweeping up
the leaves, and pressing them into huge barrows, and wheeling them away; where
the trees stand out gaunt and brown, and where the evergreens bordering the
pleasant walks rustle with the autumnal winds; where the cracks, and flaws, and
dampnesses of old country mansions begin to make themselves unpleasantly
conspicuous; and where the servants, town-bred, commence to be colded, sniffy,
to have shivers and &quot;creeps.&quot; Dreary at the seaside, where the storm-soaked,
worm-eaten jetty, lately echoing to the pattering feet of children, or the
sturdy tread of the visitor taking his constitutional, is now given over to its
normal frequenters--tarry-trousered men in blue jerseys and oilskin sou'-wester
hats, who are always looking out for some boat that never arrives, or some storm
which always comes when they do not expect it; bills are stuck on the pleasant
plate-glass bow windows so lately filled with pretty girls, rosy children, and
parents who dined at two o'clock, and enjoyed their nuts and port-wine &quot;looking
over the sea;&quot; and the proprietors of the lodging-houses, who have lived in damp
back-kitchens since June, are once more seen above-ground. Dreary in Continental
towns, where home-returning English are finding out that they have spent too
much money on their trip, and bewailing the Napoleons left as a tribute to the
managers of the Homburgh Bank; where the discomforts of the return sea-passage
first assert themselves, and where couriers and innkeepers are going in for
their last grand turn of robbery and swindle. Dreary, dreary, every where! but
specially dreary in Hyde Park, at the Piccadilly gates, at which Mr. Prescott
leaves his Hansom, and strolls into Rotten Row.</p>
<p>A blank desert of posts and rails and dry dusty gravel; a long strip of
iron-enclosed sand and grit, with half a dozen figures in the three-quarter mile
range to break the dull monotony. As Prescott mooned drearily along, at
five-minute intervals he would hear the sound of a horse's hoofs, and turning
rapidly, would find some easy-going steed doing its quiet sanitary business for
its owner, a man who, either from circumstances or disposition, never quitted
London, but was to be seen at some time or other of the day in the Row, no
matter what might be the time of year. Interspersed with these were grooms,
riding in that groomy undress of wide-awake hat, short, stiff shirt-collar, and
tight-fitting, yellow-clay-coloured trousers, trying the wind and bottom of some
that were meant to be flyers in the approaching hunting-season; beasts with
heavy, strong quarters, long backs, short, sharp heads, and rolling eyes, with a
preponderance of white always showing. Country-bred Mr. Prescott, and cannot
therefore divest himself of a certain canniness in the matter of horseflesh: now
and then he leans over the rail to follow the progress of a horseman flying
past, with his hands well down, and every muscle of his steed brought into
splendid play; or the healthy gymnastics of a valetudinarian, who had learned
exactly the utmost amount of exercise to be derived from his horse as compared
with the least amount of discomfort to be endured by himself. But these do not
rivet his attention; and he passes on until he is nearly abreast of the
Serpentine, when, looking back, he sees a blue skirt fluttering in the wind, and
in an instant recognising its wearer, pulls up by the rails and waits her
advent.</p>
<p>It does not take long for that chestnut mare to cover the distance, albeit
she is being ridden from side to side, and is evidently receiving her
&quot;finishing&quot; in the elegancies of the <i>manège</i> In less than two minutes she
is pulled up short by the rails where Prescott is standing, and her rider, Kate
Mellon, with the colour flushing in her cheeks, with her eyes aglow, with her
hair a trifle dishevelled from the exercise, is sitting bolt upright, and with
the handle of her riding-whip giving the young gentleman a mock salute.</p>
<p>&quot;Servant, colonel!&quot; says she.</p>
<p>&quot;How do you do, Kate?&quot; says Prescott, leaning forward and touching the neat
little white cuff on her wrist; &quot;I thought I should find you here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;More than I thought of you!&quot; says the lady. &quot;Why ain't you counting up those
figures, and adding and subtracting, and all the rest of it you do in your
office, eh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To-day's a half-holiday, Kitty--Saturday, you know,&quot; says Prescott, with
rather a grim smile; for he does not like that rough description of his official
duties.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, ah!&quot; says the lady, with great simplicity; &quot;Saturday, ah! Confounded
nuisance sometimes! Lost my net veil one Saturday afternoon here in the Row;
went to Marshall and Snelgrove's on my way home; all shut up tight as wax!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're better than you were yesterday, at the station?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, yes; I'm all right; I shall do well enough! Wo-ho! steady, old lady!&quot;
(this to the mare). &quot;I'm always better in town. Don't let's stand here; I can't
hold this mare quiet, and that's the truth; she frets on the curb most awful.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Most awfully, Kitty, not most awful. I've told you of that a hundred times.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, most awfully, if you like it better. Steady, Poll! Walk along by my
side. Who are you, I should like to know, to pull me up about my talking? What
right have you to lecture me about my grammar and that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What right?&quot; asks Prescott, suddenly turning white; &quot;none, save the fact of
my loving you, Kitty. You know it well enough, though I've never told you in so
many words. You know that I <i>do</i> love you! You can't have seen me hanging
about you during the last season, making excuses to come to your place, first
there and last to go, hating every man who had more chances of talking to you
than I had,--you can't have seen all this without knowing that I loved you,
Kitty!&quot;</p>
<p>The mare is pulled suddenly up; there is no one near them in the blank desert
of the Row; and her rider says, &quot;And suppose I <i>did</i> know it,--what then?&quot;</p>
<p>Prescott shrugs his shoulders and looks upon the ground, but does not reply.</p>
<p>&quot;Have you ever had one word of encouragement from me? Have you ever seen a
look of mine which has led you on? Can you say that, suppose I tell you to let
me hear no more of this,--as I do tell you at once and for ever,--I have
deceived or thrown you over in any one way?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Never!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank God for that!&quot; says the girl, with some bitterness; &quot;for that's a
chalk in my favour, at least. Now look here! I know you, James Prescott; and I
know that you're too good a man--too well brought up and fond of home and that
sort of thing--to hint any thing but what's right towards me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Kitty!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There--I know it. Don't break a blood-vessel with your emotion,&quot; she added,
gently tapping him on the shoulder with her riding-whip. &quot;All right. Well,
suppose we were married, you'd feel very jolly, wouldn't you, while you were
down at your office doing your sums and things, which you got so riled when I
spoke of just now, to think that Tom Orme, and Claverhouse, and De Bonnet, and a
whole lot of fellows, were mooning about this place with me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'd wring all their necks!&quot; says honest Jim Prescott, looking excessively
wobegone.</p>
<p>&quot;Exactly. But you see, if you wrung their necks, they would not send their
wives and sisters and daughters to be taught riding at The Den; they would not
commission me to look out for ladies' hacks, to break them, and bring them into
order; and my trade would be gone. And we couldn't live on the
twopence-halfpenny a-year you get from your office, Jim, old fellow.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know that, Kitty,&quot; said poor Prescott; &quot;I know all that; but--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hold on half a second!&quot; interrupted Kate; &quot;let us look the thing straight in
the face, and have it out, Jim, now and for ever. I know you--know you're a
thoroughgoing good fellow, straight as an arrow, and know that if you married
me, you'd stick to me till you dropped. But you'd have a hard time, Jim--an
awful hard time!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I should not mind that, Kitty. I'd work for you--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, it isn't in that way I mean. But how would you stand having to break off
with your own people for your wife's sake? How could you take me down to your
governor's parsonage, and introduce me there? How would my manners and my talk
please your mother and sisters? It's madness, Jim,--it's worse than madness,--to
talk of such a scheme. Shake hands, and let's be always good friends--the best
of friends. If you ever want a good turn that I can do, you know where I'm to be
found. God bless you, old boy; but never mention this subject again!&quot;</p>
<p>James Prescott gave a great gulp at a lump which was rising in his throat,
and warmly grasped Kate Mellon's proffered hand. As she raised her eyes he
noticed her colour fade, and saw a troubled expression in her face.</p>
<p>&quot;Good by, Jim,&quot; the said hurriedly. &quot;Just strike down that path, will you?
Get away quickly; here's some one coming; and--and I don't want to be seen
talking to you. Quick! there's a good fellow. Good by.&quot;</p>
<p>She touched her horse with her slight whip, and cantered off at once.
Prescott looked in the direction she had indicated, and saw Mr. Simnel, mounted
on a handsome thoroughbred, calmly curveting up the Row.</p>
<p>What could there be between Kate Mellon and Robert Simnel?</p>
<br>

<h5>MISS LEXDEN ON MATRIMONY.</h5>
<br>
<p>After that episode at the stile, which, as it happened, formed such a crisis
in their destinies, Barbara Lexden and Frank Churchill did not move towards the
house, but quietly turned into that fir plantation through which they had
strolled some days previously on their return from the shooting party. At first
neither spoke; Barbara walked with her eyes downcast, and Churchill strolled
idly by her side; then, after a few paces, he took her unresisting hand and
placed it in his arm. She looked, up into his face with calm, earnest, trustful
eyes, and he bowed his head until, for the first time in his life, his lips
touched hers, and as he withdrew them he murmured, &quot;My darling! my own darling!
thank God for this!&quot; His arm stole round her waist, and for an instant he held
her tightly clasped; then gently releasing her, he again passed her hand through
his arm, covered it with his other hand, and walked on quietly by her side.
There was no need of speech; it was all known, all settled, all arranged; that
restored glove, that one fervent sentence, that one look in which each seemed to
read the secrets of the other's soul, had done it all. This was first love,
undisturbed by the fact that on either side there had probably been some
half-dozen attacks of that spurious article, that saccharine bliss, that state
of pleasant torture which reveals itself in sheep-like glances and deep-drawn
sighs, in a tendency to wear tight boots and to increase the already
over-swollen tailor's bill, to groan and be poetical, and to shrink from
butchers' meat. Although the existent state of Barbara and Churchill had none of
these characteristics, it was still first love.</p>
<p>Marvellous, marvellous time! so short in its duration, but leaving such an
indelible impress on the memory! A charming period, a <i>hasheesh</i>-dream
impossible ever to be renewed, a prolonged intoxication scarcely capable of
realisation in one's sober moments. A thing of once, which gone never comes
again, but leaves behind it remembrances which, while they cause the lips to
curl at their past folly, yet give the heart a twinge in the reflection that the
earnestness which outbalanced the folly, the power of entering into and being
swayed by them, the youth--that is it, after all; confess it!--the youth is
vanished for ever and aye. What and where was the glamour, the power of which
you dimly remember but cannot recall? Put aside the claret-jug, and, with your
feet on the fender, as you sit alone, try and analyse that bygone time. The form
comes clearly out of the mist: the dark-brown banded hair, the quiet earnest
eyes the slight lissome figure and delicate hands; and with them a floating
reminiscence of a violet perfume, a subtle, delicate essence, which made your
heart beat with extra vigour even before your eyes rested on what they longed
for. Kisses and hand-clasps and ardent glances were the current coin of those
days; one of either of the former missed, say at parting for the night, for
instance, made you wretched; one of the latter shot in a different direction
sent you to toss sleepless all night on your bed, and to rise with the face of a
murderer, and with something not very different from the mind of one. There were
heartaches in those days, real, dead, dull pains, sickening longings, spasms of
hope and fear; dim dread of missing the prize on the attainment of which the
whole of life was set, a psychical state which would be as impossible to your
mind now as would the early infantile freshness to your lined cheek, or the
curling locks of boyhood to your grizzled pate. It is gone, clean gone. Perhaps
it snapped off short with a wrench, leaving its victim with a gaping wound which
the searing-iron of time has completely cicatrised; perhaps it mellowed down
into calm, peaceful, conjugal, and subsequently paternal affection. But tell me
not, O hard-hearted and worldly-minded bachelor, intent on the sublimation of
self, and cynically enough disposed to all that is innocent and tender,--tell me
not, O husband, however devoted to your wife, however proud of your
offspring,--tell me not that a regret for that vanished time does not sometimes
cross your mind, that the sense of having lost the power of enjoying such
twopenny happiness, ay, and such petty misery, does not cost you an occasional
pang. It still goes on, that tragi-comedy, the same as ever, though the actors
be different, though our places are now in the cushioned gallery among the
spectators instead of on the stage, and we witness the performance, not with
envy, not with admiration, but with a strange feeling of bewilderment that such
things once were with us,--that the dalliance of the puppets, and the liquid
jargon which they speak, once were our delight, and that we once had the
pass-key to that blissful world whose pleasures and whose sorrows now alike fail
to interest us.</p>
<p>So in the thorough enjoyment of this new-found happiness, in all tranquillity
and repose, as in a calm haven after tempest, three or four days passed over
Barbara and Churchill. Their secret was their own, and was doubly dear for being
known but to themselves. No one suspected it. Churchill joined the
shooting-party on two occasions; but as he had previously been in the habit of
detaching himself after luncheon, no one remarked his doing so now, and no one
knew that the remainder of the day until dinner-time was spent with Barbara
alone. After dinner Barbara would sometimes sing, and then Churchill would hover
round the piano, perhaps with more <i>empressement</i> than he had previously
shown (because, though fond, as every man of any sensitiveness must be, of
music, he was by no means an enthusiast, and was racked wofully with smothered
yawns during the performance of any elaborate piece), yet by no means
noticeably. And during all the time each had the inward satisfaction of knowing
that their words and actions were appreciated by the other, and that the &quot;little
look across the crowd,&quot; as Owen Meredith says, was full of meaning to and
thoroughly understood by the person it was intended to reach. At length, about
the fourth day after the proceedings at the stile, their conversation took a
more practical turn. They had been wandering slowly along, and had at length
stopped to rest on a grass-covered bank which was screened from the sight of the
distant house by a thick belt of evergreens, while far away in front of them
stretched a glorious prospect of field and woodland. As sometimes happens in
October, the sun seemed to have recovered his old July force, and blazed so
fiercely that they were glad to sit under the friendly shade. Barbara had
removed the glove from her right hand, and sat looking down at her lover, who
lay by her side, idly tracing the course of one of the violet veins in the
little hand which rested in his own broad palm. Suddenly he looked up and said:</p>
<p>&quot;Darling, this lotus-eating is rapidly coming to an end. It would be sweet
enough, thus 'propped on beds of amaranth and moly,' to remain and dream away
the time together; but there's the big world before us, and my holiday is nearly
finished.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you must go back to town?&quot; and the little fingers tightened round his,
and the shapely head was bent towards his face.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, pet; must. But what of that? When I go, it is but to prepare for thee,
my heart's darling; but to set things straight for your reception. You're
determined, child, to share my lot at once? You've reflected on what I said the
other night, about waiting a year to see whether--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, Frank, no! those long engagements are utterly hateful. There will you
be, I suppose&quot; (and she glanced slyly at him), &quot;moping by yourself, and there
shall I be with another round of that horrible season before me, thinking of
you, longing for you, and yet having to undergo all the detestable nonsense of
balls and parties and <i>fêtes</i>, which I so thoroughly despise--for what? At
the end to find ourselves a year older, and you perhaps a few pounds richer. As
though riches made happiness!&quot; said poor Barbara, who, since she had come to
what are called years of discretion, had never known what it was to have a whim
unindulged.</p>
<p>Churchill raised himself on his elbow, and smiled as he smoothed her glossy
hair.</p>
<p>&quot;My child,&quot; said he, &quot;have you never heard of the philosopher who, when told
that poverty was no crime, rejoined, 'No; no crime; but it's deuced
inconvenient'? Recollect, furnished lodgings in Mesopotamia, hack cabs to ride
in, no Parker to dress your hair, no Rotten Row--by Jove, when I think of it, I
feel almost inclined to rush off and never see you again, so horrible is the
change to which holding to me must lead you!&quot; and a dark shadow passed across
his face.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you?&quot; asked Barbara, bending so closely over him that he felt her warm
breath on his cheek; &quot;do you?&quot; she repeated with such a dash of earnest in her
jesting tone that Churchill thought it necessary to slip his arm round her, and
press his lips to her forehead in reassurance. &quot;Why, you silly boy, you forget
that when I was a child at home with papa, I knew what poverty was; such poverty
as would make what you speak of wealth by comparison. Besides, shall we not be
together to share it? And you'll buy me a--what do they call it?--a cookery
book, and I'll learn all kinds of housekeeping ways. I can do some things
already; Guérin, the Morrisons' <i>chef</i>--who was a little struck with me, I
think, sir--showed Clara Morrison and me how to make an omelette; and Maurice
Gladstone--my cousin Maurice, you know; when we were staying at Sandgate, he was
quartered at Shorncliffe--taught me to do bashawed lobster, and he says my
bashawed lobster is as good as Sergeant Pheeny's. And you know all the Guards
are mad to get asked to sup with Sergeant Pheeny, who's a lawyer, you know, and
not a soldier-sergeant.&quot;</p>
<p>And she stopped quite out of breath.</p>
<p>&quot;'You know' and 'you know,'&quot; said Churchill, mocking her; &quot;I do know Sergeant
Pheeny, as it happens, and his bashawed lobster, and that dish and omelettes
will doubtless be our staple food; and you shall cook it, and clean the
saucepans afterwards, you little goose. However, I tell you candidly, darling,
though it sounds selfish, I <i>dare not</i> run the risk of losing you, even
with all these difficulties before us. As you say, we shall share them together,
and--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now, not another word!&quot; said Barbara, placing her hand upon his lips; &quot;there
are to be no difficulties, and all is to be arranged at once. And I think the
first thing to be done is for me to speak to my aunt.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ay,&quot; said Churchill, with rather a dolorous expression of face; &quot;I am afraid
that will be what your friend Captain Lyster would call a 'teaser.' Talking
about no difficulties--we shall find one there!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I do not think so. I am sure, Frank, my aunt has shown special politeness to
<i>you</i>.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, darling, politeness of a certain kind to people in my position. Don't
frown; I have long since dropped that distinction as between ourselves. But I
mean so far as the outer world is concerned, to people in my position--authors,
artists, and 'professional people' of all kinds--mixing in society, there are
always two distinct varieties of politeness. One, which seems to say, 'You are
not belonging to <i>nous autres</i>; you are not a man of family and position;
but you bring something which is a distinction in its way, and which, so far as
this kind of acquaintance goes, entitles you to a proper reception at our
hands.' The other, which says as plainly, 'You don't eat peas with your knife,
or wipe your lips with the back of your hand; you're decently dressed, and will
pass muster; while at the same time you're odd, quaint, amusing, out of the
common run, and you present at my house a sort of appanage to my position.' I
think Miss Lexden belongs to the latter class, Barbara.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am afraid that old feeling of class-prejudice is a monomania with you,&quot;
said Barbara, a little coldly: &quot;however, I will see my aunt, and bring matters
to an issue there at once.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All luck go with you, child! There is one chance for us. The old proverb
says, '<i>Femme savante est toujours galante</i>.' Miss Lexden is a clever
woman; perhaps has had her own love-affairs, and will feel pity for ours. But,
Barbara, in case she should be antagonistic--violently, I mean--you will not--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<i>Monsieur</i>,&quot; said Barbara, with a little inflated <i>moue</i>, &quot;<i>la
garde meurt, mais ne se rend pas</i>, as Cambronne did <i>not</i> say. No, no;
trust in me. And now give me your arm, and let us go home.&quot;</p>
<p>It was a point of honour with old Miss Lexden to have the best room in every
house where she visited; and so good was her system of tactics, that she
generally succeeded. Far away in northern castles, where accommodation was by no
means on a par with the rank of their owners, duchesses had been worse lodged
and infinitely worse attended to than this old commoner, whose bitter tongue and
incapacity for reticence did her yeoman's service on all possible occasions; not
that she was ever rude, or even impolite, or said any thing approaching to
actual savagery; but she had a knack of dropping hints, of firing from behind a
masked battery of complacency, and of roughly rubbing &quot;raws,&quot; which was more
effective than the most studied attacks. As spent balls, when rolling calmly
along, as innocuous, apparently, as those &quot;twisters&quot; of Hillyer's, which evade
the dexterous &quot;dip&quot; of the longstop on the smooth short sward of the Oval, have
been known, when attempted to be stopped, to take off a foot, so did old Miss
Lexden's apparently casual remarks, after to all appearance missing their aim,
tear and wound and send limping to the rear any one who rashly chanced to answer
or gainsay her. Women, with that strange blundering upon the right so often seen
among them, seemed to guess the diabolical power of the old lady's missiles, and
avoided them with graceful ease, making gentle <i>détours</i>, which led them
out of harm's way, or cowering for shelter in elegant attitudes under projecting
platitudes; but men, in their conscious self-strength, would often stand up to
bear the brunt of an argument, and always came away worsted from the fight. So
that old Miss Lexden generally had her own way amongst her acquaintance, and one
important part of her own way was the acquisition of the greatest comfort
wherever she stayed.</p>
<p>Of course, in an easy, regulated household like that of Sir Marmaduke
Wentworth, there was no need of special strategy. Years ago, on her first visit,
she had selected her apartments, and had had them reserved for her ever since.
Pleasant apartments they were, large, airy, and with a glorious look-out across
the garden over the surrounding downs. When the windows were open, as they
always were when practicable during Miss Lexden's tenancy,--for the old lady was
a great lover of fresh air,--the rooms were filled with the perfume of the
flowers, occasionally mixed with fresh, healthy sea-smell. These had been the
state-rooms in the Grange, in bygone times; and when Miss Lexden first came
there, there was a huge bed, with nodding plumes at the foot, and a great
canopy, and high-backed solemn chairs, and a big wardrobe like a family
mausoleum but the old lady had all these cleared away, and persuaded Sir
Marmaduke to refurnish the rooms with a suite of light maple and moss-rosebud
chintz, with looking-glass let into the panels of the wardrobe, and snug little
low chairs scattered about; and then with a chintz paper, and water-colour
drawings in light frames, the place was so changed that the old housekeeper, who
had been in the family for years, scarcely knew it again, and was loud in her
lamentations over the desecration.</p>
<p>Miss Lexden was a lazy old lady, who always breakfasted in bed, and when
staying on a visit at a country house generally remained the greater portion of
the day in her room. She was accustomed to say with great freedom that she did
not amuse the young people and they certainly did not amuse her, and that she
hated all old people except herself. She was a great correspondent of all kinds
of people, wrote lengthy epistles in very excellent French to all kinds of
refugees, who were perpetually turning up in different parts of Europe, and
working the oracle for their own purposes; wrote lengthy epistles to American
statesmen on the slavery question, to English lecturers on subjects of political
economy, and to her special friends on all points of domestic scandal. I fear
that, with the exception of the last, her correspondence was not much regarded,
as she never sent to refugees any thing but her blessing and her prayers; and
these, even though coming from an English <i>miladi</i>, were not discountable
at any <i>Geld-wechsel Comptoir</i> on the Continent. But her <i>Chronique
Scandaleuse</i> was delicious; it was bold in invention, full in detail, and
always written in the most pointed and epigrammatic style. There were people who
obtained autumn invitations, on the sheer strength of their being recipients of
Miss Lexden's correspondence. Extracts from her letters were read publicly at
the breakfast-table, and created the greatest delight. &quot;Good as a book, by
Jove!&quot; was a frequent comment on them; &quot;full of humour, and that kind of thing;
sort of thing that fellow writes and people pay money for, by Jove! ought to
send it to <i>Punch</i>, that she ought.&quot; (For it is a thing to be noted, that
if the aristocracy of this great country ever permit themselves to be amused,
they invariably think that the thing which amused them, no matter of what kind
it be, ought to be sent to <i>Punch</i>.) Miss Lexden also was a great reader of
French novels; she subscribed regularly to Rolandi's, and devoured all that
sound sense, morality, philosophy, and extensive knowledge of the world, which
yearly issued from the Parisian publishers. In bygone times she had laughed
heartily over the farcical humour of M. Paul de Kock; now that her palate had
somewhat dulled. Fortune had sent her the titillating works of M. Gustave
Flaubert, M. Xavier de Montepin, M. Ernest Feydeau, and others of that modern
school which delights in calling a spade a spade, with the broad theories of M.
Proudhon to be her political guide, and the casuistries of M. Renan for her
Sunday reading. She read all, but liked the novels best; and had been seen to
weep over a yellow-covered volume in which an elegant marquis, all soul and
black eyes, a <i>membre du Jockei-Club</i>, and altogether an adorable person,
had to give satisfaction to a brute of a husband who objected to being
dishonoured.</p>
<p>With one of these yellow-covered volumes on her lap, Miss Lexden was sitting
placidly in the easiest of chairs at the open window on the afternoon when
Barbara and Churchill held the conversation just narrated. She was a
pleasant-looking old lady, with a fat, wrinkleless, full face, like an old
child, with a shiny pink-and-white complexion, and with hair which defied you to
tell whether it had been wonderfully well preserved, or admirably dyed, arranged
under a becoming cap. She was dressed in a rich brown moiré-antique silk, and
with a black-lace shawl thrown over her ample shoulders; her fat, pudgy little
hands, covered with valuable rings, were crossed over the book on her lap; and
she was just on the point of dropping off into a placid slumber, when there came
a knock at the door, immediately upon which Barbara entered the room.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, Barbara,&quot; said the old lady, stifling a yawn; &quot;is it time to dress?
I've done nothing since luncheon but read this ridiculous book, and I was very
nearly dropping asleep, and I've no notion of the time; and Withers is always
gadding about in this house with that steward, and never comes near me till the
last moment.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is quite early, aunt; scarcely six o'clock yet; and I came up to you on
purpose to have a quiet <i>cause</i> with you before you dressed. I think I have
news which will keep you awake. You've not asked me of my flirtations lately.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My dear child, why should I ask? I interested myself about Lord Hinchenbrook
because he was the <i>parti</i> of the season, and because to have carried him
off from that odious doll, that Miss Musters, as you could easily, would have
been a triumph to us both; but you refused. I interested myself about young
Chaldecott because our families had long been intimate, and the largest property
in Yorkshire is worth interesting oneself about; but you refused. You know your
own mind best, Barbara, and <i>I</i> know that you have too much good sense and
real notion of what is right to do a foolish thing; so I leave you to yourself,
and don't worry you with any questions.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks, aunt, for your good opinion,&quot; said Barbara, playing with a sprig of
scarlet geranium which she had taken from a vase on the table; &quot;but I shall give
you no further trouble. I am going to be married.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sir Charles Chaldecott has written?&quot; said the old lady, putting aside the
book, and sitting upright in her chair; &quot;has written; and you--?&quot; and in her
anxiety Miss Lexden smiled so unguardedly that, for the first time in her life,
the gold-settings of her false teeth were seen by a looker-on.</p>
<p>&quot;I--we shall not hear any more of Sir Charles Chaldecott, aunt,&quot; said Barbara
hesitatingly; &quot;no; I am going to be married to a gentleman now staying in this
house.&quot;</p>
<p>Miss Lexden's face fell; the gold teeth-settings disappeared from view
entirely; and she shrugged her shoulders as she said, &quot;Very well, my dear; I
feared something of the sort. If you like to settle on three thousand a year,
and to take a man whose constitution is ruined by the Indian climate, I can only
say--it is your affair.&quot;</p>
<p>Barbara bit her lips to avoid betraying a smile as she replied, &quot;You are
wrong again, aunt. Captain Lyster has never done me the honour of an offer.&quot;
Then seriously, &quot;I am going to be married to Mr. Churchill.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<i>What?</i>&quot; shrieked the old lady, surprised out of all decorum; &quot;what?&quot;
Then, after an instant's pause, &quot;I beg your pardon, Barbara; did I not
understand you to say that you were going to be married to Mr. Churchill,
the--the gentleman now staying in this house?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You did so understand me, aunt, and it is the fact.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then,&quot; said Miss Lexden, in rather a low, flat key, &quot;I'll trouble you to
ring the bell for Withers. It must be time for me to dress for dinner.&quot;</p>
<p>Barbara looked astonished, and would have spoken; but her aunt had risen from
her chair and turned her back on her, moving towards the dressing-table. So she
mechanically rang the bell, and left the room.</p>
<p>With the result of this conversation Churchill was made acquainted as he and
Barbara bent together over a large stereoscope in the drawing-room before
dinner. In a few hurried words, interspersed with ejaculations of admiration at
the views, uttered in a much louder tone, Barbara conveyed to her lover that
their project would meet with no assistance from her aunt, even if that old lady
did not actively and violently oppose it. Churchill shrugged his shoulders on
hearing this, and looked somewhat serious and annoyed; but as she rose to go in
to dinner, Barbara pressed his hand, and looking into her face, he saw her eyes
brighten and her lip curl with an expression of triumph, and he recognised in an
instant that her energy had risen at the prospect of opposition, and that her
determination to have her own way had strengthened rather than lessened from her
aunt's treatment.</p>
<p>There was an accession to the dinner-table that day in the person of Mr.
Schröder, a German long resident in England, and partner in the great house of
Schröder, Stutterheim, Hinterhaus, and Company, bankers and brokers, which had
branches and ramifications in all the principal cities of the world. No one
would have judged Gustav Schröder to have been a keen financier and a consummate
master of his business from his personal appearance. He was between fifty-five
and sixty years old, heavy and dull-looking, with short, stubbly, iron-gray
hair, dull boiled eyes, and thin dry lips, which he was constantly sucking. He
was clumsy in his movements, and very taciturn; but though he spoke little, even
to Miss Townshend, by whom he was seated, he seemed to derive intense
satisfaction in gazing at her with a proprietorial kind of air, which nearly
goaded Lyster, sitting directly opposite to them, to desperation. Upon his
evidently uncomfortable state Captain Lyster was rallied with great humour by
old Miss Lexden, who, however much she may have been inwardly annoyed, showed no
signs of trouble. She opined that Captain Lyster must be in love; that some
shepherdess on the neighbouring downs, some Brighton <i>poissarde</i>, must have
captivated him, and she was delighted at it, and it would do him good; and in
spite of Lyster's protestations--which, however, he soon gave up when he found
he had the trouble of repeating them--the old lady launched out into a very
unusual tirade on her part in favour of early marriages, of love-matches made
for love's sake alone, which frequently turned out the happiest, &quot;didn't they,
Mr. Churchill?&quot; At which question, Churchill, who was dreamily looking across
the table, and thinking how artistically Barbara's head was posed on her neck,
and what a lovely ear she had, stammered an inarticulate and inappropriate
reply.</p>
<p>But when dinner was over, and the post-prandial drink finished, and the
coffee consumed in the drawing-room, and the &quot;little music&quot; played, and the
ladies had retired to rest (Barbara, in her good night to Churchill, giving one
reassuring hand-pressure, and looking as saucily triumphant as before), and the
men had exchanged their dress coats for comfortable velvet lounging-jackets, and
had, in most cases, dispensed with their white cravats; when Sir Marmaduke had
nodded his farewell for the night, Churchill, instead of joining the party in
the smoke-room, made his way to the old gentleman's quarters, and knocked at the
dressing-room door. Bidden to come in, he found Sir Marmaduke in his
dressing-gown and slippers, seated before a fire (for the evenings were
beginning to be chilly), with a glass of cold brandy-and-water on a little table
at his right hand, and the evening paper on his knee.</p>
<p>&quot;Holloa!&quot; was the old gentleman's salutation; &quot;what's in the wind now? There
must be something the matter when a young fellow like you, instead of joining in
the nonsense downstairs, comes to hunt out an old fogey like me. What is it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Business, Sir Marmaduke,&quot; commenced Churchill; &quot;I want five minutes'
business talk with you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;God bless my soul!&quot; growled Sir Marmaduke; &quot;business at this time of night,
and with <i>me!</i> You can't talk without something to drink, you know. Here,
Gumble; another tumbler and the brandy for Mr. Churchill. Why don't you talk to
Stone, my dear fellow? he manages all my business, you know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, yes, Sir Marmaduke; but this is for you, and you alone. I came to tell
you that I am going to be married.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ay, ay! no news to me, though you think it is. What's his name, Beresford,
told us all about it. Well, well, deuced risky business; wish you well through
it, and all that kind of thing. Don't congratulate you, because that's all
humbug. But why specially announce it to <i>me?</i>&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Simply because it is your due. I met the lady in this house, and the first
introduction was through you. I don't know what nonsense Mr. Beresford may have
been spreading, but the real fact is that I am going to be married to Barbara
Lexden. Now you see my motive.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm obliged to you, sir,&quot; said the old man, rising from his chair, and
extending his hand; &quot;you've acted like a gentleman, by Jove! like a gentleman
and a man of honour. God bless my soul! how I recollect your father, Frank, and
how like you are to him! And so you're going to marry little Barbara! not little
Barbara now, though. How time flies! A good girl, sir; and a deuced fine girl,
too, for the matter of that. What does her aunt say to that? She meant her for
much higher game than you, young fellow. What does her aunt say? Does she know
of it?--Does Miss Lexden know of it? I'll wager there'll be 'wigs upon the
green,' as poor Dick Burke used to say, when she hears of it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Miss Lexden has heard of it, sir,&quot; said Churchill, smiling; &quot;and I'm afraid
she did not receive the news very auspiciously; but we shall endeavour to gain
her consent, and if we fail--well, we must do without it. And now I won't keep
you from your paper any longer. I thought it my duty to tell you, and having
done so, I'll say good night.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;One minute, Frank Churchill; wait one minute. I'm a queer, useless old
fellow--an old brute, I often think, for I'm not unconscious of the strange life
I lead, and the odd--but, however, that's neither here nor there. Your father
and I were boon companions--a wild, harum-scarum chap he was--and <i>such</i>
company--and I've a regard for you, which is strengthened by your conduct
to-night. My old cousin, Miss Lexden--well, she's an old lady, you know, and she
meant Barbara for a marquis, at least; and then old women hate to be
disappointed, you know, and she'll be savage, I've no doubt. But when you're
once married, she won't be difficult to deal with, and so far as I can help you,
I will. And now, God bless you, and good night; and--give Barbara a kiss for me
in the morning.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p>About the same time, another conversation on the same great topic was going
on under the same roof. Barbara had scarcely been five minutes in her room, and
had been leaning thoughtfully, with her arms upon the window-sill, gazing out
into the moonlit park, and utterly oblivious of Parker, who was preparing the
instrument of torture for her mistress's hair, when Withers arrived with a
message that Miss Lexden wished to speak to her niece. Obedient to the summons,
Barbara crossed the landing, and found the old lady, resplendent in a dark-blue
cashmere dressing-gown, seated before her fire. Withers dismissed <i>pro tem.</i>,
Miss Lexden said:</p>
<p>&quot;I'll not detain you long, Barbara. I merely wished to know whether what you
said this evening about your intended marriage with Mr. Churchill was jest or
earnest.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thorough earnest,&quot; replied Barbara, regarding her stedfastly.</p>
<p>&quot;As to marriage, I mean?&quot; asked the old lady; &quot;not as to a temporary
flirtation, which, <i>faute de mieux</i>, with a pleasant man in a dull country
house, is well enough, and not likely to tell against one's interests. But as to
marriage?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What I said before, aunt,&quot; said Barbara slowly, never dropping her eyes, &quot;I
repeat. Mr. Churchill has done me the honour to ask me to become his wife. I
have consented, and I mean to keep my word.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very well,&quot; said Miss Lexden, drawing a long breath; &quot;I only wished to know.
You are your own mistress, and control your own actions, of course. You have
made your choice, and will abide by it. I don't seek to influence you one jot.
But, recollect one thing: if I were to see you with broken health, with broken
spirits, ill-used, deserted, starving--as is likely enough, for I know these
people--I would not lift one finger to help you, after your degradation of me. I
have said it, and you know I keep my word. That is all; we will have no quarrel,
and give no occasion for shoulder-shrugs and scandal. The sooner your
arrangements permit of your quitting my house, the better pleased I shall be.
Now, good night. Withers, I am ready now. See Miss Lexden to her room. Good
night, dear.&quot;</p>
<p>The old lady proffered her enamelled cheek, against which Barbara laid the
tip of her nose. And so the aunt and niece separated for the night.</p>

<h5>MOTHER AND SON.</h5>
<br>
<p>At the drawing-room window of a house in Great Adullam Street, Macpelah
Square, in that district of London whilom known as &quot;Mesopotamia,&quot; a lady had
been sitting from an early hour in the afternoon until now, when twilight falls
upon the neighbourhood. This, I am aware, does not particularly fix the hour,
because twilight falls upon the Mesopotamian neighbourhood earlier than on any
other with which I am acquainted. You leave Oxford Street in a blaze of
sunlight, which bit by bit decreases as you progress through the dingy streets
and the dull, vast, second-rate squares, until when you enter upon the confines
of Great Adullam Street you find the glory of the day departed, a yellow fog
settling gloomily down, and the general aspect suicidal. At the time of which I
am speaking, the twilight had been a settled thing for at least an hour,--it was
approaching six o'clock. The lamps were lighted, and the inhabitants of the
neighbouring houses had pulled their blinds down and settled in for the night;
but still at No. 57 the lady sat in the drawing-room window, staring out into
the yellow fog. The street lamp flickering on her showed her to be a woman of
about sixty years old, with clean-cut regular features, intelligent but sweet
expression, and with gray hair--almost white--arranged in broad bands on either
side her face. Her dress was black silk, with a soft white-muslin cape pinned
across her breast, and on her head she wore a plain white-muslin cap with a
little crimped border. On her hands she had black-lace mittens, and she wore a
few old-fashioned but valuable rings. A glance at her would have proclaimed her
a lady to the most casual observer, a woman of taste and refinement and
sensibility to the physiognomist; and a further study would have shown the
latter deeply-indented traces of mental anxiety and suffering.</p>
<p>Indeed, Eleanor Churchill's life had not been a particularly happy one.
Daughter of a country clergyman near Bath, she lost both her parents before she
was eighteen, and remained in the school where she was being &quot;finished&quot; after
their death, giving her services as teacher for her board and lodging. Here she
was seen and admired by Vance Churchill, who attended the school as
drawing-master; a wild young fellow, full of talent, who worked (at intervals)
like a horse, and whose splendid method of touching-up the pupils' drawings, so
as to make them look all their own, redeemed many of his shortcomings, and
caused him to be continued in favour at Minerva House. But when he fell in love
with the pretty teacher, and muttered love to her as he was sharpening
pencil-points, and was seen by the writing-master--an old person of seventy, who
was jealous of his young <i>confrère</i>--to hand her a note in a copy of the <i>
Laws of Perspective</i>, and on being taxed with his crime acknowledged it and
gloried in it, it became impossible for the Miss Inderwicks, as the girls called
them, or the Misses Inderwick, as they called themselves, to stand it any
longer. So both the delinquents were discharged; and having nothing to live
upon, they at once got married, and came up to London. Once there, Vance
Churchill set to work with a will: he drew on wood, he lithographed, he drew
languishing heads for the music-shops, and caricatures political and social; he
finished several elaborate sketches in water-colour and in oil; but he sold
scarcely any thing. There was not that demand for art in those days there is
now, and consequently not that chance of livelihood for its possessors; and
Vance Churchill and his young wife were very near to starvation indeed, and had
buried one little girl-baby, who, had luxuries been provided for her, might have
lived, when a small picture of Lady Macbeth, which had found a place in the
Somerset-House Exhibition, was seen and purchased by Sir Jasper Wentworth, our
old friend Sir Marmaduke's uncle and his predecessor in the baronetcy. From that
time Vance Churchill's fortune was looked upon as made; for Sir Jasper, who had
a nice eye for art, took him up, introduced him right and left, and got him
commissions without end. Young Marmaduke, a free-spoken, jolly young man, coeval
with the artist, took an immense fancy to him, and was never happy save in his
society; money was, if not plentiful, always to be had,--and Eleanor Churchill
was more wretched than she had ever been in the days of her direst poverty.</p>
<p>For though Vance Churchill could struggle against poverty, neglect, and
hardship, he could not withstand ease, comparative wealth, and the attractions
of society. He was eminently a &quot;social&quot; man; a big, jolly jovial fellow, with
bright blue eyes, large brown whiskers, and a splendid set of teeth. He had
capital lungs, and sang a capital song in a deep baritone voice, and he had nice
feeling in his singing, which so seldom accompanies correct musical execution;
but when Vance Churchill sang &quot;Farewell, my trim-built Wherry,&quot; or &quot;Tom
Bowling,&quot; all the female portion of his audience was in tears, while the men
felt husky and uncomfortable. He became the rage in a certain set of fast young
men about town, and in that pleasant Upper Bohemia wherein so many literary men,
artists, and actors of that day used to spend their time; not a Bohemia of
taprooms and sanded floors, of long clay-pipes and spittoons and twopennyworths
of gin, nor of Haymarket night-houses and drunken trulls, nor of blind-hooky and
<i>vingt-et-un</i> parties in dingy chambers; but a Bohemia of green-rooms and
<i>coulisses</i>, of sparkling little suppers afterwards at Vauxhall, where wit
would flow as fast as the champagne, where jokes would be more telling than the
hot punch, and whence the mad party would not unfrequently dash away in their
carriages to breakfast at the Star and Garter at Richmond, or to drink fresh
milk and eat fresh butter in a Hampstead farmhouse. A Bohemia, the denizens of
which always would have good clothes and fine linen on their backs, gold watches
in their pockets, and guineas in their purses, let who would pay for it; and who
roared with laughter at the astonishment of the world at their vagaries,
increasing their eccentricities, and saying of the world as Balzac's actress
said, &quot;<i>Qu'importe? donne leur des grimaces pour leur argent, et vivons
heureux!</i>&quot;</p>
<p>Petted and fêted by the style of society in which he revelled, Vance
Churchill had yet the grace not to attempt to force his wife to join it; indeed
he had good reason for keeping her away. For the ladies liked Vance Churchill
vastly, and Vance returned the compliment, and behaved just as though there were
no moral and legal ties binding him to any one in particular. He loved his wife
sincerely all the time, and in his quiet moments would tear his hair, and stamp
upon the ground, and curse his own weakness and folly, and his treatment of that
angel who sat patiently at home attending to and teaching their little boy, and
who never reproached him save by her pale face and broken spirit; and then, as
evening came round, Marmaduke Wentworth would call for him, or the servant would
bring him a dainty little note, written in a very scrawly hand, which she would
hold in the corner of her dingy apron, and which Vance would seize from her, and
after reading it he would sally out, and commence his vagaries <i>da capo</i>.</p>
<p>Preaching before Mary Queen of Scots and her maids of honour, old John Knox
is reported to have said: &quot;Oh, how beautiful, how charming, how pleasurable
would be this life, <i>if it would only last!</i>&quot; These were Mr. Vance
Churchill's sentiments, but he soon found that it would not last. What the
writers of those ghastly impositions, bacchanalian ditties, call &quot;wine and
women,&quot; or &quot;beauty and the bowl,&quot; don't agree with hard work; and if you go to
bed at five a.m. after orgies, you will not be able to paint your pictures next
day, or to write your book, or mould your clay, or study your part. It is
astonishing how slow people are to believe this, and how, year after year, we
see friends and acquaintances still determined, not merely upon burning the
candle at both ends, but lighting any bit of wick that may protrude in the
middle, and quite astonished when they see the flame flicker and feel the whole
affair about to collapse. Vance Churchill had plenty of commissions for pictures
from first-rate people,--noblemen, connoisseurs, and patrons of art,--but he did
not give himself the chances of painting them: his brain was never clear enough
for conception, his hand never steady enough for execution; and the result was,
that his financial affairs became desperate. His noble patrons never dreamed of
parting with their money until the work was done--and in truth not often then;
and there were in those days no middle-men, no bland picture-dealers, to advance
large sums on untouched canvases; and even if there had been, they would have
been far too wise to let Vance Churchill have any money on the strength of
&quot;working it out.&quot; So the money dwindled and dwindled, and then Vance began
borrowing of his friends until he found averted faces and buttoned pockets, and
then he faded straight away out of his grand society, and took lodgings at
Chelsea, and tried once again to work for his livelihood. He painted one
picture, which showed but few traces of his old force and promise. It was plain
that the mischief was done; and then Vance Churchill, after steadily drinking
for four days, was found one morning with an empty laudanum-phial in his
clenched fingers, and a heartbreaking letter to his wife by his side.</p>
<p>Then Eleanor Churchill--who, while perfectly conscious of her husband's
frailties and imperfections, had never ceased worshipping him--fairly broke
down; and had she not been attended by a skilful physician, and perseveringly
nursed night and day by the girl who had been &quot;scrub&quot; at Miss Inderwick's
school, and had left when Eleanor left to follow her fortunes, little Frank
would have been motherless as well as fatherless. As it was, she recovered, and
went away, as soon as she was able to move, to a little fishing-village in
Devon, of which an old friend of her father's was vicar. Her income was a mere
pittance; contributions from old friends of her husband's family and her own
grudgingly yielded; but her expenses were trifling, and the old parson took the
boy's education under his own charge, and gave him an excellent classical
groundwork. The vicar died when Frank was about fifteen, and left the whole of
his little savings--some seven hundred pounds--to Eleanor Churchill, &quot;for the
furtherance of her son's education;&quot; and then the widow carried out her
long-cherished plan of sending her son to some foreign university, where, in
addition to his Classics, he could perfect himself in some of the modern
languages. Frank was absent at Leipzig nearly four years, during which period he
paid two flying visits to England, at the second of which he was introduced to
his godfather, Sir Marmaduke Wentworth, who had succeeded to the family title on
his uncle's death. Frank little thought that one of Sir Marmaduke's first acts
on coming into his property had been to settle two hundred a year on Mrs.
Churchill for her life; he would hear of no refusal. &quot;It is merely an act of
reparation,&quot; said he; &quot;and but a scanty one. It was my folly, my bad example,
that led poor Vance astray; and I should never rest if I thought that those he
left behind him were in want, while I had means.&quot; But one condition was attached
to this gift, and that was that Frank should never know of it. &quot;I recollect
Vance's spirit in his best days,&quot; Marmaduke said; &quot;and if the boy is like him,
he'd fling my money at my head.&quot;</p>
<p>After taking his degree, Frank was fortunate enough to render himself so
agreeable to young Fortinbrass, the son of the great Indian pale-ale brewer,
that that young plutocrat insisted on taking him with him as half-secretary,
half-bear-leader, in his tour through Europe and the East; and as they stopped
at every place where there was any thing to be done, and a good many at which
there was nothing to be done, and as they had the usual share of quarantine, and
as Fortinbrass took ill at Smyrna and had to lay up for four months, it was,
full three years before Frank returned to England. Then he determined to settle
down and get to work in earnest; and after a few rebuffs and discouragements,
philosophically encountered, he made his mark in the press world, and obtained
constant and fairly remunerative employment. Then the house in Great Adullam
Street was taken, as handy to the <i>Statesman</i> office, Frank's
head-quarters, and furnished partly with the best of the Devonshire furniture,
and partly with odds and ends bought cheap at sales, for the joint income was
but small, and Eleanor had a wholesome horror of debt. And then the full tide of
Eleanor Churchill's happiness flowed in: she had loved her husband; she had
worshipped his memory in her holy of holies; she had preserved his image, and
had bowed down before it; with his death vanished all his shortcomings, but his
better qualities--the early affection, kindness, and chivalry--were remembered.
But now that her son was with her, the old image faded and rapidly paled. Here
was one uniting the excellences of his father with virtues which his father
never possessed, tempering high spirits and ardent affection with earnestness,
industry, and honour; no mawkish sentimentalist, no prudish Pharisee; a man of
passions and impulse, yet a Christian and a gentleman, and above all--her own
boy. That was the touchstone; that was the grand secret. He had his flirtations,
of course; his intrigues, perhaps; but he was her son, her companion, and she
was his honoured mother, but she was also his trusted friend. All his hopes and
fears, all the fun and gossip of the day, were brought by him to her; he talked
to her on books and art and social questions; he read to her and with her; he
advised her on her own reading, and he brought home with him men of European
fame and name, and introduced her to them, and made much of her before them. <i>
If it would only last!</i> Beware of that, Eleanor Churchill! Some one must
reign after you, and with her uprising must be your downsetting. It was ever so.
Ask not why tarry the wheels of his chariot, for the news that he brings with
him will wring and torture your fond, trusting heart.</p>
<p>The old lady's face, which had grown somewhat worn and rigid in watching,
brightened as she heard the sound of wheels in the distance, and as she saw a
hansom cab come plunging and rattling over the uneven stones, to be finally
pulled up with a jerk before the door.</p>
<p>As Frank Churchill sprang out, he looked up to the window and waved his hand.
In a minute he had run upstairs and was in his mother's arms.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, my boy, how late you are!&quot; said Mrs. Churchill, as she relaxed her
embrace. &quot;You must be famished for your dinner, my poor fellow!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Excursion-trains, mother, your favourite doctrine of health and change for
your old <i>protégé</i> the working-man, you know, have contributed to your
anxiety and my delay. We were stopped at Forest Hill for a train full of people,
with drooping hats and feathers and banners and bands and general tomfoolery,
who had been having a day at the Crystal Palace.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, so long as you're here and all safe, that's all the old mother cares
about, Frank. Dinner, Lucy, now, at once; Mr. Frank's half-starved. Let me look
at you, my boy, and see whether the trip's done you any good. Eh, you're
certainly tanned, and a little stouter, Frank, I think.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps so, mother, though I've been taking more exercise than usual too.
Any news? I saw a pile of letters on the study-table as I rushed past, but I
didn't stop to look at them. Any body been?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Harding was here yesterday, to see if you had returned from among the
'swells,' as he called them. I think he's a little envious of your going into
such society; eh, Frank?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not a bit of it, mother; nothing would take old George Harding beyond his
own set. But he's afraid of my getting my head turned.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No fear of that in my boy,&quot; said Mrs. Churchill somewhat gravely; &quot;there is
the difference between you and your poor father, Frank. And now, how is Sir
Marmaduke? and what sort of people were staying there? and was he kind and
friendly to you? and how did you enjoy yourself?&quot;</p>
<p>As Mrs. Churchill finished speaking, Lucy the old servant entered the room
and announced dinner. She was a tall gaunt woman, with a hard unpleasant face,
which did not soften much when Churchill, looking up, said, &quot;Well, Lucy, back at
home, once again, you see.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I see, Master Frank,&quot; the woman replied coldly. &quot;We've been waiting
dinner until we must be faint, I should think.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bat it wasn't Mr. Frank's fault, Lucy,&quot; said Mrs. Churchill; &quot;the train was
late. Now, my boy, come; you must be starved in earnest;&quot; and they went
downstairs.</p>
<p>&quot;We've not got such a dinner for you as you've been having lately, maybe,&quot;
said Lucy, as she uncovered the dishes. &quot;But you can't be always among lords and
ladies, Master Frank.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Lucy, you silly thing!&quot; said Mrs. Churchill, half-laughing, but looking
half-ashamed.</p>
<p>&quot;I've not been among them at all, Lucy, for the matter of that,&quot; said
Churchill good-humouredly, though his brow began to cloud.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said the woman, leisurely handing the dishes, &quot;it's not for the want
of wishing. Here we are, left at home, in the hot autumn weather; while you--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Lucy!&quot; exclaimed Mrs. Churchill.</p>
<p>&quot;Be good enough to leave the room,&quot; said Churchill; &quot;this minute!&quot; he said,
bringing his hand heavily down on the table, as the woman lingered, looking
towards her mistress. &quot;Why, mother darling, what is this?&quot; he asked, when they
were alone; &quot;that woman's tongue was always free, and her manner always
familiar; but this is quite a new experience.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is, my child,&quot; said poor Mrs. Churchill; &quot;I don't know how to excuse her,
except that it is all done out of excess of affection for me, and--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's quite enough excuse for me, mother,&quot; said Churchill, rising, and
kissing her. &quot;There, now we'll change the conversation;&quot; and they talked merrily
enough on indifferent topics throughout dinner.</p>
<p>When the cloth was removed, and after Frank had produced his old meerschaum,
and had drawn up his chair to the newly-lighted bit of fire, he said to his
mother, &quot;I've some news to tell you, mum.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tell it, my boy!&quot; said the old lady, settling her gold-rimmed glasses on her
nose, and beginning to make play with a portentous piece of knitting; &quot;what is
it, Frank?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, it's news that concerns both of us,&quot; said Churchill, slowly puffing at
his pipe, &quot;but me more especially. The fact is, mum--I'm going to be married.&quot;</p>
<p>It had come at last! that news which she had dreaded so many years past, that
news which spoke to her of separation from all she loved, which heralded to her
the commencement of a new existence--had come at last! Her heart seemed to give
one great bound within her breast as the words fell upon her ears, and her eyes
were for an instant dimmed; then recovering herself, she smiled and said, &quot;To be
married? that is news indeed, my boy!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ay, mother, my turn has come at last. I thought I had settled down into a
regular old bachelor, but I believe that is just the state of mind in which one
is most liable to infection. However that may be, I have caught it, and am in
for it, as badly as any young lad of twenty.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Churchill had risen from her seat, and crossed the room to Frank.
Putting her hand lightly on his head, she then flung her arms round him and
kissed him warmly, saying, &quot;God bless you, my darling boy, and grant you
happiness! God bless you, my son, my own son!&quot; and she fairly broke down, and
the tears coursed down her cheeks.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, mum!&quot; said Churchill, gently caressing her; &quot;why, mum!&quot; continued he,
stroking her soft gray hair with one hand, while the other was wound round her.
&quot;You must not do this, mum. And here's a mother for you! I declare she has never
yet asked who or what the lady is!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That will come presently, darling; just now I am only thinking of
you--thinking how different it--how, after so long--how strange--there, come
now, and tell me all about it;&quot; and with one great effort Mrs. Churchill
composed herself, and sat down by her son's side to hear his story.</p>
<br>
<p>That story lasted far into the night. Frank told of all his hesitation; of
his determination not to propose; of the accident that brought about the great
result of his happiness; and of the manner in which the affair was viewed by old
Miss Lexden. He then said that he and Barbara were determined upon getting
married at once, and that he had come up to town principally with the view of
looking out some lodgings which he could take in the neighbourhood for them to
return to after their honeymoon. His mother listened patiently throughout, with
her calm, earnest eyes fixed upon his face, and only now and then commenting in
a low tone; but when he finished, she laid her hand on his and said quietly:</p>
<p>&quot;You will bring your bride <i>here</i>, Frank, and I will go into the
lodgings. Henceforth this house is yours, my boy! You are the head of our family
now, and I--so long as I'm near you and can see you from time to time, what more
do I want? So long as you are happy, I am happy, and--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But you don't imagine, mother, I'm going to turn you out, and--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There's no turning out in the case, my darling. Lucy and I could not occupy
the house by ourselves, and we shall be much better in lodgings. Besides, we
won't have any one say that you had not a house of your own to bring your wife
to. I shall see her soon, Frank? Do you think she'll like me, my darling? When
she knows how I love you, I am sure she will; and yet I am not certain of that.
You'll come and see me often, won't you, Frank? and--oh, my boy, my own darling
boy!&quot; and she fell on his neck and wept bitterly.</p>

<h5>&quot;FOR BETTER, FOR WORSE.&quot;</h5>
<br>
<p>When Churchill returned to Bissett, he found that a considerable change had
taken place in the aspect of affairs there. Beresford and Lyster had departed,
and old Miss Lexden was on the point of starting that very afternoon, her natty
boxes in their leather cases lining the hall; for the old lady was calmly
implacable, and never altered one jot of her original determination. After his
talk with Frank Churchill, Sir Marmaduke had determined on using his best
efforts towards restoring peace, and setting affairs on an amicable footing; so
the next morning, when he was closeted with Major Stone discussing various
points of business, the old gentleman gradually wore round to the matter
perplexing him, took Stone into his confidence, and finished by commanding the
major immediately to seek a conference with Miss Lexden, to inform her of Sir
Marmaduke's views, and use his best efforts to bring her at least to a
compromise. The gallant warrior received the commission with a very ill grace.
He hinted that to look after his friend's rents and tenants, farm and
live-stock, servants and money-matters, was all well enough; but to have to
collogue with a parcel of old cats who--however, since it was to be done, he
supposed he must do it; and he would &quot;tackle&quot; the old lady at once. But the old
lady carried far too many guns for this blundering half-pay Major, and before he
had been in her company five minutes made him feel exceedingly sorry that he had
asked for the interview. Miss Lexden received him in the pleasantest manner,
talked lightly of the weather, praised in the highest terms Major Stone's
admirable management of Sir Marmaduke's estate, could not imagine how Sir
Marmaduke would get on without his &quot;other self;&quot; and then, when Stone's
flattered vanity led him to disclose the real object of his visit, Miss Lexden
pulled up short, and in her most dignified and icy manner declared that &quot;these
were family matters, which allowed of no intervention by a third person,
especially one entirely unconnected with either side, and therefore incapable of
appreciating the delicacies of the position; what, for instance, would Sir
Marmaduke have thought of her if she had sent Withers to enter into
negotiations!&quot; and thus having completely upset the Major, Miss Lexden summarily
dismissed him.</p>
<p>When he returned to his principal, and gave him a full account of his
treatment, the old gentleman was very wrath, and took a speedy opportunity of
waiting personally upon Miss Lexden.</p>
<p>After exchanging ordinary civilities, their conversation was short and sharp.</p>
<p>&quot;Susan! you're behaving sillily, worse than sillily, in this matter of
Barbara and Frank Churchill; and I've come to tell you of it!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's not the first time, Marmaduke, that you have come to me on a fool's
errand.&quot;</p>
<p>First blood to Miss Lexden the old man thought of the days of his courtship,
when he owed but little to Susan Lexden's assistance, and winced.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you! You're kind and generous as ever! But it was not to talk of
bygone times that I came here. Take my word, Susan, you're wrong in your
treatment of this business.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As how, pray?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You've played for a big stake with Barbara, and she won't have it! She's
fallen in love, in real desperate love; no make-believe humbug, but regular
love!&quot;</p>
<p>Miss Lexden shrugged her shoulders, raised her eyebrows, and tattooed
impatiently with her foot.</p>
<p>&quot;God knows she's to be envied,&quot; said the old gentleman; &quot;how many girls are
there, do you think, who are booked for marriage before next spring, who would
give their ears to feel to their future husbands as Barbara does to hers? It's
not about her I'm come to preach, it's about you. You're behaving like an idiot,
Susan,--worse than an idiot,--in thus refusing your countenance to the match.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're growing horribly coarse in your language, Marmaduke, and unfit for me
to listen to. But since you've broached the topic, hear me: I shall leave
Bissett at once; and once gone, I shall never see Barbara again. I shall not
give her one sixpence for her <i>trousseau</i>, or make one addition to her
wardrobe. I will not allow her a penny, and I will strive to forget that I ever
knew there was such a person on earth. She has grievously disappointed me, and
been selfish and ungrateful; but I shall not cast her off, or do any thing
melodramatic or nonsensical; I shall simply ignore her existence, and live on as
though she had never been.&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Marmaduke retired, boiling over with rage. An hour afterwards he sent
for Barbara to the library and placing a cheque for 100<i>l</i>. in her hands,
told her he had arranged with Mrs. Vincent to accompany her to town and get the
requisite articles for her <i>trousseau</i> at once. Her aunt was about to
leave, he said; but Mrs. Vincent had promised to stop and act <i>chaperon</i>,
and Miss Townshend would be bridesmaid. Let the wedding take place at once,
since both the young people wished it, and let it be from Bissett. There would
be no fuss, no tomfoolery; but no one should be able to say in future that there
was any thing underhand or secret about her marriage, or that it was not
properly countenanced by some of the family. If her aunt chose to be an old
fool, that was her look-out, not his. And then the old gentleman kissed her on
the forehead, and told her that while he lived she and Frank should never want a
friend.</p>
<p>Miss Lexden left on the evening of the day on which Churchill returned,
without seeing him or taking farewell of any of the household. Mr. Townshend
would have liked to go too, but his daughter strongly objected, determining to
remain with Barbara; a determination in which she was well supported by Mr.
Schröder, who had taken great interest in Barbara's &quot;love-affair&quot; ever since it
had been made public--as apparently seeing therein an excess of romance which
might cast a halo over his own somewhat meagre and prosaic wooing. Mrs. Vincent,
too, entered into the affair with great spirit, principally incited thereto by
her hatred of old Miss Lexden, who had been particularly rude about Mr.
Vincent's little gastronomical tastes; and Sir Marmaduke seemed for a time to
have eschewed his eccentricity, and to have become perfectly humanised. Of
course Major Stone was in great force, rallying the lovers with much subtle
humour, and looking after all the preparations for the wedding with as much
interest as though he were a person principally concerned.</p>
<p>The day arrived, and the weather did its very noblest for the young people.
The sky was cloudless, and the sun brilliant, if not warm. Barbara was in the
finest health and spirits, and never looked more lovely than in her plain white
silk dress and Brussels lace--the latter an old family relic. The wedding took
place at the little parish-church, where three bells rang a somewhat abbreviated
but merry peal, while the villagers thronged the churchyard and did proper
obeisance and gratulation to a party coming from &quot;the Grange.&quot; Afterwards there
was a breakfast, at which no one save the clergyman and the house-inmates were
present, where there was only one speech of four words,--&quot;God bless them both!&quot;
from Sir Marmaduke; and then, kisses and hand-shakings done, they departed. As
Churchill shook hands with the old gentleman, the latter left an envelope in his
godson's hands, which, on opening, he found to contain a banknote for fifty
pounds, with the words &quot;For the honeymoon&quot; in the envelope. Nor had Barbara been
without her presents. On the previous evening she had received a packet
containing a necklace of ivy-leaves in dead deep-coloured gold, with earrings to
match, and in the case Captain Lyster's card, with &quot;With all good wishes&quot;
written on it; while a splendid enamel and diamond bracelet came to her as the
joint gift of Mr. Schröder and Alice Townshend.</p>
<br>
<p>While the happy couple were honeymooning it in the north of Devon,
unconsciously standing as capital models of posed figures to several artists who
had lingered beyond most of their fraternity in those pleasant quarters, old
Mrs. Churchill, having engaged a tolerably neat lodging not far from her old
abode, devoted herself and some of her savings to the embellishment of the house
in Great Adullam Street, which was newly painted outside, and revived within to
the extent of new carpeting and a general polishing of the furniture.
Intelligence of these triumphs had been duly conveyed in letters to Frank, who
in return, thanked his mother, and sent a postscript by Barbara, who, addressing
her as &quot;her dear mother,&quot; begged her not to over-fatigue herself in their
service; which little message, signed &quot;Your affectionate daughter, B. C.,&quot;
brought tears of delight into the old lady's eyes, and had the effect of causing
her to redouble her exertions. At last the day for their return arrived, and the
rain, which had been threatening for nearly a week past, broke through the
yellow canopy of fog hanging over London, and came down heroically. It was not
favourable weather in which to make one's first acquaintance with Great Adullam
Street, which required a good deal of sunlight to do away with its normal
ghastliness; and as the evening twilight, drear and dim, came rolling up,
Eleanor Churchill, sitting at the window of her lodgings on the look-out for the
cab, which must pass her door, felt her heart sink within her with a strange,
indefinable sensation of dread. Her delicacy had prevented her being present on
her new daughter's first arrival at her home; but she now almost regretted that
she had not gone round to welcome her among her new and strange surroundings.
Great Adullam Street very seldom had a cab rattling over its ill-set stones;
there was a large gate at one end (as is frequently the case in the
neighbourhood), where every public vehicle was stopped, and sent by a different
route, at the mandate of a very sullen gate-keeper, unless it happened to be
bound to some house in the street. So that when Mrs. Churchill heard the
creaking gates open, followed by the noise of wheels, she knew that her children
had arrived, and looking out, saw by the lamplight Barbara's handsome face at
the cab-window. &quot;Handsome, very handsome and patrician-looking,&quot; thought the ow
lady; &quot;but what a strange look of bewilderment on it!&quot;</p>
<p>The cab stopped, and Churchill jumped out and handed Barbara into the house.
Lucy, old Mrs. Churchill's servant, stood within the door, and gave a very grim
bow as Barbara passed; the two newly-hired servants were smirking in the
passage. Frank hurried past them, and led Barbara into the little dining-room.
She was very tired with her journey, and at once sat down.</p>
<p>&quot;Who was that horrid person, Frank, at the door,--with the strange sour look,
I mean?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, my mother's servant, old Lucy; been with her since her girlhood. She has
not prepossessing manners, but she's a faithful creature. You'll make much of
her, dearest.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing, I should hope; she's too horrible! What a disagreeable colour this
paper is, and what a horribly prim carpet! I'll take off my things, Frank, at
once, and come down to dinner; I'm rather faint.&quot;</p>
<p>Churchill lit a candle, and preceded her up the stairs--at the carpet on
which Barbara made a despairing shrug--to the best bedroom, erst his mother's,
where stood the heavy four-post bed, the old-fashioned mahogany wardrobe, the
dingy pictures of sacred subjects--all the furniture just as he recollected it
for years. It was rather a ghastly room, certainly; and when Frank had left her,
to go down and pay the cabman and see about the luggage, she glanced nervously
round, and burying her face in her hands, burst into a flood of tears.</p>
<p>Thus her husband found her when he returned. He a once rushed up to her, and
asked her what was the matter; but she replied that she was a little
over-fatigued, and would be better after the dinner and rest.</p>
<p>&quot;That's well,&quot; said Frank cheerfully; &quot;you must not give way now, darling;
recollect you're <i>at home</i>.&quot;</p>
<p>At which words, strange though it may appear, Barbara's sobs were redoubled.</p>
<br>

<h5>MINING OPERATIONS.</h5>
<br>
<p>No sooner was the Churchills' wedding safely over than all further reason for
keeping on the establishment at Bissett Grange was at an end, and the party
broke up at once. Sir Marmaduke went straight to Paris, and took up his quarters
at Meurice's, according to his annual custom, to the disgust of Gumble, who
detested all things &quot;forring&quot; with that pious horror always to be found in the
British serving-class. The old gentleman knew Paris better perhaps than he knew
London, and was thoroughly well known in the best circles of Parisian society;
his eccentricity, <i>quelque chose bizarre</i>, which distinguished him from the
ordinary run of English visitors, made him popular with the young people, while
his perfectly polished manner to women, the unmistakable not-to-be-acquired
high-breeding of the true gentleman, combined with his ready wit and biting
sarcasm, both expressed in perfect French, rendered him a favourite with his
coevals. To the Faubourg and its inhabitants, however, his visits were
principally confined; he had never yielded allegiance to the Imperial Court, and
used to speak of it and its august head in a very disparaging manner. &quot;Gad,
sir!&quot; he would say in the smoke-room of Meurice's, after his return from the
Français or from some grand reception,--&quot;Gad, sir! I've a very low opinion of
your what d'ye call him?--your Emperor! met him often when he was in
England,--at Gore House, and two or three other places; always found him a
silent, moody, stupid fellow--that's it! a stupid fellow, by Jove!--tries to
make out that he holds his tongue to think the more; like the monkey, you know.
My belief is, that he's so deuced quiet because he's got nothing to say. And his
surroundings, my dear fellow! his surroundings, awful! De Rossignol, who was a
billiard-marker or a singer at a <i>café chantant</i>, or something of that
kind; Oltenhaus, the financier, who is a Polish Jew, of the worst stamp; and
O'Malley, the Marshal, a mere Irish adventurer! That is not the sort of stuff
for Courts, sir!--the sweepings of the Boulevard theatres, the Juden-Gasse at
Frankfort, and the long-sword, saddle, bridle, whack-fol-de-rol, and all the
rest of it, of the bold dragoon! <i>Vieille école bonne école</i> is a good
maxim, by Jove! They mayn't be clever; but they're gentle-people at least, and
that's not saying a little for them!&quot;</p>
<p>So the old gentleman growled to the little select circle round him, enjoying
himself meanwhile in the highest degree. Perhaps one of the most gratifying
results of his sojourn in Paris he could not have explained, though at the same
time he was, however unconsciously, keenly sensible of it; it was that he had
Gumble at his mercy. So desolate, so bored, so completely used up was that great
man, that he looked forward to the time of his master's retiring for the night,
and getting up in the morning, as the only two happy periods in his Parisian
existence. All the toilet-ceremonies, before held by him in deep disgust, were
now lingered over with the utmost fondness, and every scrap of gossip was
brought forward in the chance of its provoking a discussion, and protracting the
period when the valet should be again relegated to the company of the French and
German waiters and pert ladies'-maids, who scoffed at Gumble's old-fashioned
ways and stories. Of course there were other gentlemen's gentlemen installed
with their masters at Meurice's; but they were all much younger than Gumble; and
when their &quot;governors&quot; were not expected home till late, beguiled the weary
hours with pleasant dances at the Salle Valentino, or suchlike resorts. But
Gumble was a little too old, and a great deal too insular, to enjoy these
recreations. Once indeed he had been persuaded into attending one of these
public balls; but the sight of his deep white choker, straight-brushed whiskers
aid solemn old mug, had such an effect on the dancers,--Jules utterly missing
his great bound in the <i>cavalier seul</i>, and Eulalie failing to touch her <i>
vis-à-vis</i> shoulder with her toe in the <i>en avant deux</i>,--that he was
requested to confine his <i>tristesse</i> to some other place; and as he was
really not amused, he willingly consented. So, after that, he remained at
Meurice's, generally sitting solitary in a crowd of chattering French servants,
beguiling the time sometimes by speculating how long his master would live, and
what he would leave him at his death; whether a greengrocer's or a public-house
would be the most profitable business to undertake with Sir Marmaduke's legacy;
whether he could get any thing for the recipe of some wonderful boot-varnish
which he alone possessed; sometimes by reading a shilling novel of fashionable
life, or nodding dreamily over the <i>Times</i> of the previous day. One night,
as he was attending his master to bed, he brought forth a special bit of news
which he had reserved.</p>
<p>&quot;House full here, sir,&quot; said he, as he was mixing the old gentleman's evening
draught.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; growled Sir Marmaduke. &quot;God bless my soul, pack of people come over by
the rail devilish cheap, and all that sort of thing. Poor dear old diligences
kept the place dear; that was one comfort. Full, eh? Any body I know?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Capting Currer, from the Forring Office, come in to-night, sir; saw he had a
white shammy-leather bag with him, sir--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! Queen's messenger off to-morrow morning to Smyrna or Kamschatka, or some
infernal place. Any body else?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Miss Lexden come, sir; but we was full here, just full; so she have gone
next door to the Windsor, sir. Only Withers with her, sir; no one else. Must
miss Miss Barbara, sir--Mrs. Churchill, sir--I shouldn't think, sir.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What the devil business is it of yours? What right have you to think about
it? There now; be off! Good night.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bless my soul!&quot; said the old gentleman, when he was left alone. &quot;I'm deuced
glad Susan didn't get in here, or she'd have led me a pretty life. I suppose I
must call on her to-morrow morning. Deuced unpleasant 'talk there'll
be--Barbara, and all the rest of it. Poor girl! Susan--too hard--come round at
last;&quot; and musing in this way Sir Marmaduke fell asleep.</p>
<p>When, in the course of the next day, he called upon Miss Lexden, he found
that lady in the highest spirits. &quot;I knew you were here, Sir Marmaduke,&quot; said
she. &quot;I've had Cabanel here;--you recollect little Cabanel? Spanish-looking
little fellow with black eyes; was an attaché when the Walewskis were in London;
and he saw you at the duchess's last week. You're going there to-morrow of
course? How well you look! that's the climate, you know, and the style of life;
so much better than in that wretched old island of ours.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What news do you bring from that wretched old island of ours?&quot; asked the old
gentleman.</p>
<p>&quot;News? none; not a scrap, positively not a scrap; nobody in town, not a soul.
I didn't wait there above a day, but came through at once.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You did not stop long enough to see the Churchills, I suppose?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The--eh? I beg your pardon, I did not catch the name.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Churchills.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Churchills!&quot; echoed Miss Lexden, with the greatest deliberation;
&quot;Churchills! I have not the least idea who you mean.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; said Sir Marmaduke, through his closed teeth. &quot;No, of course not; you
don't recollect your own brother's child, even when there's no one in town. If
it had been in the season, I could not have attempted to suggest any thing so
horribly low; but I thought perhaps, that when there was not a soul in town, as
you said, you might have thought of the girl who is of your blood, and who has
been, as it were, your daughter for ten years.&quot; And the old gentleman stamped
his stick on the floor, and looked fiercely across at his cousin.</p>
<p>&quot;O--h!&quot; said Miss Lexden, perfectly calmly. &quot;I didn't follow you at first;
now I see. It seems strange to me that a man with your knowledge of the world,
Marmaduke Wentworth,--more especially with your knowledge of me, derived in
times past, when you had full opportunity of making yourself acquainted with my
character,--should have imagined that I should for an instant have altered in my
purpose as regards my niece Barbara. What is there to induce me to swerve one
atom from--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; interrupted Sir Marmaduke; &quot;What? Old age, Susan Lexden! You and I
are two old people, who ought to be thankful to have been left here so long; and
not to bear malice and all sorts of miserable hatred in our old age, more
especially to our own kindred. You're vexed with Barbara, not unnaturally, as
you'd set your heart upon seeing her married to a rich man; but that's over now,
and so make the best of it. Her husband's a good fellow and a gentleman; so what
more do you want?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What more!&quot; exclaimed the old lady; &quot;what more! Freedom from this style of
conversation; permission to go my own way without comment or impertinent
suggestion. I use the adjective advisedly; I claim my right to visit those whom
I like, to ignore those whom I dislike, without such remarks from those who I
distinctly say have no right to make them. And, however old I may be, I am not
yet sufficiently in my dotage to show affection, kindness, no, nor even
recognition, to those who have wilfully disregarded my desires.&quot;</p>
<p>So Sir Marmaduke retired worsted from the conflict, and contented himself
with writing a letter to Major Stone, bidding that worthy: take the first
opportunity of a visit to town to ascertain how Churchill and Barbara were
getting on.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Mr. Beresford, after leaving Bissett, went for a short visit to a bachelor
friend with a shooting-box in Norfolk; and after enjoying some excellent sport,
and nearly boring himself to death, in the company of his host and a few
hard-drinking sporting squires of the neighbourhood, returned to town--to his
lodgings in South Audley Street, and to his daily routine of life. He did not at
all dislike London in the autumn, when he had no calls to make; when he could
wear out his old clothes; could smoke in the streets at any hour without loss of
dignity; could get a little quiet reading and a little quiet play-going; and
need not fear the admonitory missives of duns, who concluded that all their
customers were, or ought to be, out of town at that dull season. Moreover, he
had not spent all of the last two hundred pounds he had borrowed, and had
received his October quarter's salary; so that, on the whole, he was in very
good case, and came smiling radiantly into Simnel's room on the first morning
after his return. Mr. Simnel, as usual, had a pile of papers before him; but he
pushed them aside at Beresford's entrance; rose up, welcomed him; and placing
his back against the mantelpiece, at once entered into conversation.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, Mr. Commissioner,&quot; he commenced; &quot;so you've got back to the hive, eh?
and now I suppose you mean to remain and let one of the other hard-worked
members of the Board have a little rest, eh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Beresford; &quot;I'm a fixture now for a long time; I must take to
the collar, and stick to it; but you, old fellow,--do you mean to say you've
been here all this blessed time?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I've not moved away yet,&quot; said Simnel; &quot;some one must do the work, you
know,&quot; he added with a meaning grin.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I knew, of course; and a deuced hard grind you've had of it. But you'll
go away now, I suppose?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No; I shall run down to Leicestershire and get a little hunting next month
perhaps that is, if I can get away; and I might take a fortnight in Paris at
Christmas, just to avoid the 'God bless yous!' and 'Happy years!' and other
jackass congratulations, which I hate and abominate.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Genial creature!&quot; said Beresford, regarding him with great complacency
&quot;what's the news?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's just what I should ask you,&quot; retorted Simnel; &quot;there's no news here.
Sir Hickory has been to the Lakes, and 'my lady' was much pleased with
Ullswater; which is more, I should think, than Ullswater was with 'my lady,'
always supposing Ullswater to have any taste. Old Peck has slept as much as
usual but has not devoted as much time as he generally does to his get-up, and
has consequently been rather red and rusty about his beard. O'Scanlon has been
dying for your return, that he may get away; and the men in the Office are just
the same as ever. Oh, by the way, I see that marriage has come off?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Which marriage?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That man Churchill, who was staying with you at old Wentworth's, has married
that dashing girl--what was her name--?--Lexden!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes; and the <i>other</i> marriage has come off. Old Schröder is one flesh
now with Miss Townshend; that's a nice thing to think of, isn't it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ay, I heard of that too; saw it in the paper of course; but beyond that, one
of the young fellows here, Pringle, had cards; he's a connexion, or something of
the sort.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes; they've taken a thundering big house in Saxe-Coburg Square,--in the new
South-Kensington district, you know,--and are coming out heavily. There's a
dinner there on Thursday, to which I'm asked; and a reception afterwards. It's a
bad time of year; but there <i>may</i> be some new fillies trotted out, you
know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! you've done nothing more in that matter, I suppose? no one on hand just
now! no combination of money and beauty, as Jack Palmer says, when he rides with
Schwarzchild into the City?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;None! I've had no chance; but I should think this wouldn't be a bad opening.
They are a tremendously well-tinned set at Schröder's; and he's safe to ask no
women who are not enormously ingotted. With such girls, unaccustomed to any
thing but what was Paddington and is now Tyburnia, one might have a chance, for
they've seen nothing decent yet, you know. Your stock-brokering gent is a
hopeless beast!&quot; And Mr. Beresford shrugged his shoulders, and then looked down
at his feet, as though Capel Court lay beneath them.</p>
<p>&quot;You're going to the dinner?&quot; asked Simnel.</p>
<p>&quot;Going, my dear fellow! if you had been staying for the last month, as I
have, with Jim Coverdale, you wouldn't ask the question. No better fellow than
Jim breathes, and there's always capital sport to be got at his place; but the
cooking is something indescribably atrocious. One always feels inclined, when he
asks you what you'd like for dinner, to use the old <i>mot</i>, and say, '<i>Chez
vous, monsieur, on mange, mais on ne dîne pas</i>.' After a month's experience
of Coverdale's cook, I am looking forward with eager anticipation to the
performances of such an artist as Schröder will probably employ.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I should think,&quot; said Mr. Simnel, after a minute's pause--&quot;I should think it
probable that Mr. Townshend will be there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;First dinner after his daughter's marriage,&quot; said Beresford. &quot;Duty, by Jove
Of course he will.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If he is there, I want you to do me a favour,&quot; said Simnel, quietly.</p>
<p>&quot;And that is--?&quot; asked Beresford, in whose ears the word 'favour' always rang
with a peculiar knell.</p>
<p>&quot;A very slight one, and involving very little trouble to you; else, you may
take your oath, I know you too well to expect you'd grant it,&quot; said Simnel, with
some asperity. &quot;No! I merely want you, in the course of conversation, and when
you have fully secured Mr. Townshend's attention, to introduce, no matter how,
the name of a firm--Pigott and Wells.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pigott and Wells!&quot; repeated Beresford, mechanically.</p>
<p>&quot;Pigott and Wells. Should he ask you any thing farther, you will remember
that it is the name of a cotton firm in Combcardingham; and take care that it
fits into your story. That's all!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It won't get me into any row, will it?&quot; asked the cautious commissioner;
&quot;you're such a tremendously sly old <i>diplomate</i>, such an infernal old
Machiavel, that I am always afraid of your getting me into a mess.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sweet innocent! you need not fear. There's no harm in the name. Of course,
it depends upon yourself how you bring it in.&quot;</p>
<p>And Mr. Beresford, with a vivid recollection of owing eight hundred pounds to
Mr. Simnel, undertook the commission.</p>
<p>About the same time Mr. Schröder's domestic arrangements were being discussed
under the same roof, in No. 120.</p>
<p>&quot;What are you going to do on Thursday night, Jim?&quot; asked Mr. Pringle of Mr.
Prescott.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing,&quot; said Mr. Prescott.</p>
<p>&quot;Then don't,&quot; said Mr. Pringle. &quot;It don't answer and it don't pay. I've got a
card for a party in Saxe-Coburg Square, and I'll take you if you like to come.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I don't like to come. I'm sick of all your parties, with the same
grinning and bowing nonsense, the same bosh talked, the same wretched routine
from first to last. Who are the people?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now, what a duffer you are!&quot; said Mr. Pringle; &quot;first you declaim in the
strongest virtuous indignation against all parties, and then you ask who the
people are! Well; they are connexions of mine. Old Townshend, my godfather,
who's an old beast, and who never gave me any thing except a tip of half-a-crown
once when I was going to school, has married his daughter--deuced pretty girl
she is too--to a no-end rich City party--Schröder by name. And Mrs. Schröder is
'at home' on Thursday evening, 'small and early;' and I've got a card, and can
take you. There's a dinner-party first, I hear, but I'm not asked to that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What a pity!&quot; said Prescott; &quot;your true philosopher only goes to dinners.
Balls and receptions are well enough when one is very young; but they soon pall.
There is in them an insincere glitter, a spurious charm, which--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, thank ye,&quot; interrupted Mr. Pringle; &quot;for which see <i>Pelham passim</i>,
or the collected works of the late Lord Byron. Much obliged; but I subscribe to
Mudie's; and would sooner read the sentiments in the original authors. What I
want to know is, whether you'll come?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, then.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, you will. I know you, you old idiot, and all the reason for your
moping,--as though that would advance the cause one bit. Yes, you will. We'll
dine at Simpson's; have a quiet weed in my chambers; dress there; and go into
the vortex together.&quot;</p>

<h4><a name="div1_18" href="#div1Ref_18">CHAPTER XVIII.</a></h4>
<h5>THE SCHRÖDERS AT HOME.</h5>
<br>
<p>Mr. Beresford was thoroughly well-informed when he announced Miss Townshend's
marriage with M. Gustav Schröder. That event took place almost immediately after
the break-up of the party at Bissett Grange, and Sir Marmaduke attended it on
his way through to Paris. The wedding was a very grand affair, and created quite
a sensation in the dead time of the year. A bishop, who in his private capacity
held some land which he had sold to a railway company numbering Mr. Townshend
among its directors, was entrapped for the ceremony, which, of course, took
place at St. George's, Hanover Square. There was such a gathering of carriages,
and such a champing and stamping of horses in George Street, that two men who
were sleeping at Limmer's, on their way through town, were actually induced to
shake off dull sloth so early as eleven A.M., and to peer out of the window at
the cavalcade; satisfying themselves with a very short glance, however, and
returning to their couches again with great alacrity. Very great magnates in the
banking world, the brokering world, the colonial-export world, and the shipping
world, were present; as were M. Heinrich Schröder, representative of the house
at Frankfort, a bent shrivelled old gentleman, with marked Jewish profile; thin
hands always plucking at his thin lips, and a very small knowledge of the
English language;--M. Louis Schröder, who represented the house at Paris, a man
of forty, short, stout, genial, and jolly; speaking all languages with equal
ease; with a keen eye for making money, but enjoying nothing better than
spending it; drinking very little, but fond of high-living and high-play; and
showing general sensuality in his thick scarlet lips and short pudgy hands; more
Schröders, male and female, from Hamburg, from Mainz from Florence; and
one--very much burnt up--who had just returned from losing his liver, and
gaining his fortune at Ceylon. Mr. Townshend contributed the eminent personages
in City firms above mentioned, but none of his family were present; and it was
remarked by some of the guests, that none of his family had ever been seen by
any body,--any body meaning, of course, any body in their society; but, owing to
its being the dull season of the year, Miss Townshend's list was not as
brilliant as it might have been. For instance, ever since as a child she married
her doll to a resplendent individual in a soft scarlet-cloth coat, a cocked hat,
and a pair of linen trousers (supposed to be of the male sex, but really another
doll in disguise, as proved by the lump of painted hair projecting behind), she
had always intended having eight bridesmaids; but Clara Hamilton and Kate
Brandon were away with their people and in their places she had asked the
Melville girls, people, whom, as she afterwards found, her trump card, her
prettiest bridesmaid Carry Seaward, did not speak. So that the cards had all to
be shuffled again, and eventually she got four very pretty attendants to the
altar. Barbara and her husband were away honeymooning; and she didn't like to
ask Captain Lyster, having a perfect recollection of that morning in the library
at Bissett, and thinking that his presence on such an occasion would probably
render them both extremely uncomfortable.</p>
<p>But altogether the wedding went off with success; for the bishop was not only
impressively solemn during the ceremony, but was pleasantly jocose afterwards,
cracked tepid little jokes with infinite gusto; and a tepid jokelet from a
bishop is worth more than a brilliant <i>mot</i> from a professional wit. And
the company, though not very brilliant in intellect, was quite brilliant enough
to laugh when a bishop said a good thing; and every body was very well dressed;
and the wedding presents, duly set out on a side-table, made a splendid show.
The Schröders were to the fore in the matter of wedding presents; the City
magnates of the Townshend connexion did pretty well, so far as silver
tea-services, and wine-coolers, and ice-pails, and fish knives and forks, and
splendidly-carved ivory tankards with massive silver covers, were concerned, and
in all the usual wedding-gift nonsense of butter-dish and card-bowl; but the
Schröders gave diamond-necklaces and sets of turquoises and opals in
old-fashioned filigree settings, and tiny watches from Leroy's, costing 3000
francs, and Barbedienne's rarest bronzes, and the choicest carvings from the
Frankfort Zeil. Mr. Schröder, too, had taken his bride elect, two days before
the marriage, to Long Acre, and shown her the neat little single brougham, and
the elegant open carriage; and then had driven on to Rice's, and had had trotted
out the fast trotters and the elegant steppers which had been reserved for them.
And Alice Townshend thought of all these things as she stood at the altar beside
the elderly gentleman with the small eyes and the stubbly gray hair; and the
shudder which passed through her, as she solemnly vowed to honour and obey him,
was a little mitigated by the recollection of his wealth, and her consequent
future position.</p>
<p>The honeymoon was spent partly at Brussels, partly at Paris, and then the
newly-married couple came home to their house in Saxe-Coburg Square. Fifteen
years ago, just before the first Great Exhibition (<i>the</i> Great Exhibition!
we who had <i>gelebt und geliebt</i> before '51 know how poor the other one was
in comparison to it!), the tract of land whereon Saxe-Coburg, Gotha, Coleraine,
and Dilkington Squares, Adalbert Crescent, and Guelph Place now stand, was known
as Grunter's Grounds, and was tenanted by an honest market-gardener, who found a
very remunerative market in Covent Garden for his cabbage cultivation. But
Hodder, the great builder, marked the army of luxury marching rapidly west; and
knowing that quarters must be found for it, saw in Grunter's Grounds the exact
place for the erection of those squares, crescents, terraces, and places, of
which his architect, Palladio Hicks, had so elaborately shown the elevation on
paper, but had erected so few. Mr. Hodder discovered that the nurseryman was in
the last eighteen months of his lease, and that Grunter's Grounds belonged to a
charity, the trustees of which were always quarreling among themselves. This was
enough for Hodder; he soon wormed his way into the confidence of some of the
trustees; and eventually succeeded in getting the renewal of the lease refused
to the market-gardener, and the ground made over to him, on building lease, at a
very cheap rate. Now do you wonder why Mrs. Hodder drives one of the most
stylish equipages in the Park; or why, in her amateur theatricals, she manages
to get hold of all that extraordinary histrionic genius, which, by an odd
concurrence of events, always accompanies the possession of a clerkship in the
Treasury? That was a splendid speculation for Mr. Hodder. There are thirty-six
houses in Saxe-Coburg Square, for instance; and each of them lets at 320<i>l</i>.
a-year. They are all, as Mr. Thackeray said of the Pyramids, &quot;very big,&quot; and
very ugly; great gaunt stuccoed erections, bow-windowed, plate-glassed, and
porticoed after the usual prevalent pattern, with a small square courtyard
looking into a mews behind, and Mr. Swiveller's prospect, &quot;a delightful view
of--over the way,&quot; in front. But they let wonderfully; it is the thing to live
in that quarter; and hangers-on to the selvage of fashion, clerks in public
offices, who have married into aristocratic poor families, and suchlike, will be
found bargaining for a ghastly little hole in Adalbert Crescent or Guelph Place,
when they could get a capital roomy house at Highgate or Hampstead, with a big
garden, in which their &quot;young barbarians&quot; could be &quot;all at play&quot; from morning
till night, for far less money. Mr. Schröder's house was furnished very
expensively, and, considering all had been left to the upholsterer, in not bad
taste. The dining-room was in light oak, carved high-backed chairs in green
morocco; a large massive round-table in the centre, with half-a-dozen swinging
moderator-lamps over it; Wardour-Street Rubenses and apocryphal ancestors on the
walls. Behind this the library in dark oak, splendid writing-table, quaint old
carved Davenport desk from a Carmelite monastery; wonderful collection of books,
the result of the blending of two library sales at Hodgson's,--one the gathering
of a bibliomaniacal <i>virtuoso</i>, the other of a sporting nobleman,--and
before-letter proofs, after Landseer. The drawing-rooms I should utterly fail in
endeavouring to describe, so content myself by remarking that they were halls of
dazzling light,--allowed by their worst enemies, the critics, to be &quot;delicious;&quot;
by their most captious, to be &quot;effective,&quot;--splendidly furnished, and opening on
to conservatories and boudoirs and canvas-covered balconies.</p>
<p>Mr. Schröder was not the man to hide his candle under a bushel; nor, having
spent a vast amount of money on his house and its decorations, to keep them
solely for the contemplation of himself and his wife: so it was at his
suggestion that the dinner-party and reception were organised. Mrs. Schröder at
once gave her acquiescence; indeed, just at this period of her life, she was in
too dazed a state to do any thing more than follow suit. She knew her father to
be wealthy, and always had lived in good style; but she also knew that her
parent was a great tyrant--one of those &quot;stern&quot; persons so popular in novels;
and she had had many visions of resisting him; of flying from his roof with some
young lover not overburdened with riches; of love in a cottage, and other
maniacal ideas of the same description; and now she found that the time had come
and passed; that she had not resisted at all; and that she was settled down with
a gray-headed, elderly husband, who was one of the richest men in London. It was
not her childhood's dream, perhaps; but it was by no means uncomfortable; and
Mrs. Schröder wisely determined, to accept the riches, and to forget the
grayness of the head; and went in for the dinner-party with spirit.</p>
<p>Husband and wife furnished about an equal complement of friends to the
banquet, which was very splendid, but at first rather dull. Old Heinrich
Schröder, who had not yet returned to Frankfort, was present; and as he spoke
scarcely any English, he did not enliven the conversation; which, however, was
often polyglot. The magnates from the City and their wives ate a good deal, and
talked very little; while some of the younger and more aristocratic people
brought in by Mrs. Schröder were silent as becomes &quot;swells,&quot; and only
occasionally worked eyebrow or shoulder telegraphs to each other, in silent
wonder at, and depreciation of, their neighbours. Mr. Beresford began to be
awfully bored, and tried topic after topic without meeting with the least
success. At last, however, he seemed to have stumbled on one that awoke a
certain amount of general interest.</p>
<p>&quot;Seen your newly-elected brother-director of the Terra-del-Fuego Company yet,
Mr. Schröder?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Colonel Levison?&quot; said Mr. Schröder; &quot;no, not yet; we've had no board-day
since his election.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Man of mark, sir,&quot; said an old gentleman, who had painted his chin and
shirt-front with turtle-soup.</p>
<p>&quot;What Levison is it, Beresford?&quot; asked Captain Lyster, who was seated near
Mrs. Schröder.</p>
<p>&quot;Jack Levison; you know him. Wonderful life he's had!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Has he?&quot; said Mrs. Schröder, on whom the dulness had settled like a pall.
&quot;Oh, do tell us about it, Mr. Beresford; that is, if you may.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, yes, I may,&quot; laughed Beresford; &quot;though it's nothing much to tell. Jack
was in the 9th, and came into five thousand pounds at his father's death; sold
out; speculated in cotton, and made it twenty; speculated in hides, and lost
every sixpence. Went out to Australia on the first discovery of gold; was a
boot-black in Melbourne; actually had a stand and brushed boots, you know;
afterwards was cad to the Ballarat omnibus; fact, give you my word! At last got
up to the diggings; worked with varying luck, until at last turned up monster
nugget, and hit upon a splendid vein; stuck to it quietly, and made a fortune.
Realised; came back to England, and has doubled it. Curious life, isn't it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How very odd!&quot; said Mrs. Schröder, trying to extract a remark from a very
gorgeous lady on her right; &quot;fancy, blacking boots!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And what do you call 'em to a bus?&quot; said the lady, who, though gorgeous, was
Clapham-born, and still possessed her native dialect.</p>
<p>&quot;Must be clayver man,&quot; hazarded a tall, thin gentleman, a light of the Draft
and Docket Office, who was very short-sighted, and perpetually kept in his eye a
glass, with which he endeavoured to focus somebody into conversation; hitherto
hopelessly.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; said his neighbour, a bald man, with cinnamon whiskers, whose life
was passed in saying the wrong thing in the wrong place--&quot;oh, yes; but don't you
know he's Boswell Levison's brother. He's a Jew!&quot;</p>
<p>Every body looked involuntarily at old Heinrich Schröder, about whose origin
there could be no doubt, and who had that face which you may see repeated by
hundreds in the Frankfort Juden-Gasse.</p>
<p>&quot;Ha! ha!&quot; said the old gentleman, catching the last word, and finding himself
the centre of attraction; &quot;was Chew! ya, zo; Chew ist goot.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Schröder turned a dull lead colour, and a general awe-struck silence fell
upon the company, which was broken by Beresford, who, again coming to the
rescue, said:</p>
<p>&quot;You knew Levison, Monkhouse? We stayed together in his uncle's house two
years ago.&quot;</p>
<p>The man with the eyeglass made a vain attempt to focus Beresford, and said,
&quot;Did we?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, of course we did. You recollect, at Macarum's, near Elgin?&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Monkhouse dropped his glass from his eye, and looked up to the ceiling
for inspiration; then, re-fixing it, said, &quot;Oh, ah! Elgin! I know!--where the
marble comes from?&quot;</p>
<p>The Levison subject now being evidently exhausted, and the conversation
becoming hopelessly-idiotic, Captain Lyster strikes in at a tangent, and asks
Mrs. Schröder whether she has seen any thing recently of her friend, Mrs.
Churchill,--Miss Lexden that was.</p>
<p>Mrs. Schröder replies in the negative, adding that she had called upon
Barbara &quot;in, oh, such a strange street!&quot; but had not found her at home: the
Churchills had been asked to dine there that day, but had declined on account of
Mr. Churchill's engagements. It was, however, probable that they might come in
the evening. Hearing the name of Churchill mentioned, Mr. Beresford chimes in.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, by the way, the Churchills! friends of yours, Mrs. Schröder? How are
they getting on? Love-match, and all that kind of thing, hey? Clever man,
Churchill; but should have kept to his own set; married the daughter of his
printer or publisher, or some fellow of that sort; not taken away one of our
stars.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean by his own set, Mr. Beresford?&quot; said Lyster, rousing
himself. &quot;Mr. Churchill, I take it, is a gentleman in every sense of the word. I
don't know whom you have been accustomed to associate with, but I never saw a
better-bred man.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Beresford pauses for a moment, startled at the attack; then a smile
passes over his face as he says, &quot;I didn't impugn your friend's breeding,
Captain Lyster; but I suppose even such a Corydon as you would allow the folly
of a love-match with no money on either side?&quot;</p>
<p>It is probable that Captain Lyster might have replied, even seeing, clearly
as he did, that the tendency of the conversation was towards an argument in
which he would have to exert himself; but the cinnamon-whiskered man, who had
been waiting for an opportunity of speaking, now saw his chance, and burst
forth--&quot;Love-match!&quot; said he; &quot;no money on either side! What then? Do you
imagine that two people, young, attached to each other, who risk a--a--what d'ye
call um?--fight in the great battle of life&quot;--looking round and repeating &quot;in
the great battle of life--are not much happier than those who make, what you may
call, sordid matches? Thus, for the sake of argument, an elderly man marries a
young girl; nothing in common between them; she simply married for position, or
to oblige her parents; and he--well, I think we know the contemptible figure he
cuts; a case of buying and selling, as you would say in the City, eh, Schröder?&quot;
and the cinnamon-coloured man, who was great at a debating-society, looked in
triumph at his host.</p>
<p>Mr. Schröder, more leaden-coloured than ever, said, &quot;Certainly.&quot; Mrs.
Schröder, who had been looking down at the table, and playing with her
dessert-knife, rose with the rest of the ladies, and left the room. After their
departure, the West-end section, including Beresford, Lyster, and Monkhouse,
seemed to get silent and abstracted; while Mr. Schröder's particular friends
from the City, the bank-directors and public-company men, re-invigorated
themselves with port, and discussed the politics of Threadneedle Street and the
chances of change in the discount rate in hoarse whispers. Solemn dulness fell
upon the West-end division: Lyster dropped into a semi-dose; Mr. Monkhouse tried
to focus the talkers one by one, but failing, fell to polishing his eyeglass and
admiring his nails; the cinnamon-whiskered man cut into the conversation once in
the wrong place, and, having plainly showed himself to be an idiot, was promptly
extinguished; and Beresford fell into a dreamy state, in which his liabilities
ranged themselves in horrible array before him, and he went into wild
speculations as to how they might be met. While in this state, he became
conscious of old Mr. Townshend's voice, laying down the law, in most imperative
style, on matters of finance, and suddenly he remembered his promise to Simnel.
He waited for his opportunity when Mr. Townshend ceased for an instant, and then
said: &quot;My dear Mr. Schröder, you can't tell how horrible it is for us
impecunious people to listen to this tremendously ingotted talk. We look upon
you as a dozen Sinbad the Sailors, each having found his own peculiar treasure
in the Valley of Diamonds. Ah! if it were only given to me to fathom the secret
of money-making!&quot;</p>
<p>The City section were pleased at this concession, and took the remarks as
complimentary. Mr. Schröder smiled, and said sententiously: &quot;Business has its
cares as well as its pleasures.&quot; Mr. Townshend nodded his head, saying, &quot;You
gentlemen despise our prosaic ways and business routine; with you--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Business routine!&quot; exclaimed Beresford. &quot;Why, you make a fortune by the
arrival of a telegram, by the nod of a cabinet-minister's head. I'm not so
ignorant of these mercantile matters as you may fancy. When I was in the habit
of staying with my intimate friend Pigott, of the firm of Pigott and Wells--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What name did you say?&quot; asked Mr. Townshend, with a blanched face.</p>
<p>&quot;Pigott and Wells,&quot; repeated Beresford slowly, looking at him stedfastly;
&quot;merchants of Combcardingham. Do you know the firm?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, not at all. That is--I--&quot; and Mr. Townshend's teeth chattered as he
gulped down a bumper of port and cowered in his chair, as a tremendous knock,
reverberating through the house, announced the arrival of the first guests for
the reception.</p>
<p>The reception. <i>Item</i>, Herr Klavierspieler, the celebrated <i>pianiste</i>,
who was so fall of soul, and so mysterious, and so thin, and so long-haired, and
so silent. All sorts of stories afloat about Herr Klavierspieler,--that he
communed with spirits; that he was a ghoule; that he was consuming away under an
unrequited passion for an Austrian countess of excessive haughtiness; whereas in
real truth he was the son of a saddler in the Breite Strasse of Dresden, and his
liver was deranged, perhaps by his eating five heavy meals a day, and, save when
he was playing in public, never being without a pipe in his mouth. <i>Item</i>,
M. Bloffski, the Pole, <i>the</i> violincellist of the world, a fat man in
spectacles, who perspired a great deal, breathed through his nose, had a
red-cotton pocket-handkerchief, and played his instrument divinely. <i>Item</i>,
Mr. Schrink, musical critic of the <i>Statesman</i> newspaper, a little man with
a hump-back and a frightfully sensitive ear; a little man who would cower and,
shrink under false notes, and stamp and growl under bad singing; a little man
whom every one hated, and who did not particularly like himself. <i>Item</i>,
Fräulein Wünster, one of those German young ladies who, ever since Jenny Lind's
success, have been imported into England under the firm idea that they were
&quot;going to do it,&quot; and who, having filled up gaps in the Hanover Square and St.
James's Hall concerts, have returned to <i>Vaterland</i> without having made the
smallest mark. Mr. Dabb, fashionable artist, whose portrait of Mr. Schröder
decorated the walls, was there; as was Mr. Fleem, the author of <i>Fashion and
Satire</i>--a young gentleman who, for a cynic, seemed on remarkably good terms
with himself and his fellow-creatures. Mr. Pringle and Mr. Prescott arrived
together; and just after the gentlemen came up from the dining-room, Mr. and
Mrs. Churchill were announced.</p>
<p>If Mrs. Churchill had been the Empress of Austria or the Queen of the
Cannibal Islands, she could not have entered the room more haughtily, or created
a greater effect. She was dressed in a plain dark-gray silk, with a bunch of
scarlet geraniums in her hair, and a black-lace shawl over her shoulders. Her
little head was erect, her delicate nostrils distended, and her eye seemed to
challenge any unpleasant remark. Frank Churchill was, as usual, quiet and
sedate; but it was evident he marked the impression which his wife made, and was
pleased thereby. Was he pleased with the expression of her face, as he marked it
contracted for an instant, though immediately afterwards the features resumed
their calm statuesque immobility? Was he pleased with the tone of her voice,
which became a little hard and metallic, instead of that soft whispering which
he knew as hers? Barbara's trial was on her at that instant: she had returned to
that society in which she had all her life lived; those luxuries, which had been
in daily use, were around her, after she had been for weeks absent from them;
the mere size of the rooms, the lighting, the perfume, the presence of
guests,--all seemed to render the events of the past months as a dream; and she
had to bring her presence of mind into play to argue with herself.</p>
<p>Mrs. Schröder rushed up to her at once; no doubt of the <i>empressement</i>
of her manner! affection a little too palpable, as Barbara thought.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Barbara darling! so glad you're come! I thought you'd disappointed us.
How late you are!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Frank was detained; as I expected, Alice; make him explain himself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No occasion for that, I hope? Mrs. Schröder,&quot; said Churchill; &quot;the slaves of
the lamp, you know!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, there! that horrible business! your constant excuse; you're all alike.
Gustav! Gustav! here's Mr. Churchill excusing himself from being late, and
pleads business; take him away, and discuss the wretched subject together. I
want to talk to Barbara,--a long talk. No, Gustav! I don't care what you say
about my duties as hostess: I <i>will</i> talk to my old friend!&quot; So Schröder
and Churchill went off, and Alice and Barbara seated themselves in a far window.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, Barbara dear, tell me every thing. I needn't ask you if you're happy;
that's a matter of course. Do you like your house? Is the boudoir in pale-green
silk, as we always said we'd have it? Mine's in rose-colour; but that's Gustav's
taste; I always liked your notion best.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My boudoir, Alice? you forget.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, so I do. How ridiculous! But look here, Barbara darling; you'll come out
for a drive with me whenever I fetch you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, thanks, Alice; I'm too far out of your way to be fetched often.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not a bit, Barbara; what else have the horses to do? though it is a
difficult place to find out. Edwards--the coachman, I mean--had never heard of
it, though he knows all sorts of short cuts; and we had to ask our way
perpetually.&quot;</p>
<p>Barbara had something on the tip of her tongue, but it was never framed into
words. She contented herself with saying, &quot;the situation is handy for my
husband, you know. I should not like the thought that he had far to come late at
night.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! is he ever out late at night? How dreadful! how dull you must be! how
wretched for you! I should make my maid sit up and read me to sleep.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There has been no need for any such violent measures at present,&quot; said
Barbara, with a slight smile. &quot;Frank has managed to do his work at home,
hitherto; but of course there may be occasions when he will be obliged to be
out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You must come to us then. Promise! won't you, Barbara dear? You'll like Mr.
Schröder; at least I think you will. He's very quiet; but so kind-hearted and
thoughtful. Oh, Captain Lyster! how you startled me!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very sorry, Mrs. Schröder,&quot; drawled the Captain, creeping leisurely towards
them; &quot;wouldn't have put you out for the world; but this is scarcely fair, you
know; two ladies monopolising each other when we're dying to talk to them; and
we're left to listen to that horrible hirsute wretch who's thumping the piano.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Klavierspieler a horrible wretch! Did you hear that, Barbara? Well, Captain
Lyster, I won't monopolise Mrs. Churchill any more, and you shall have a chat
with her;&quot; and Mrs. Schröder walked off, laughing. Barbara had been looking at
Mr. Schröder, who was standing in the doorway talking with Frank Churchill; and
had noticed his face fall as Lyster approached them. When Mrs. Schröder moved
away, her husband seemed relieved.</p>
<p>Captain Lyster sat down by Barbara, and talked long, and for him earnestly.
She saw at once that he wanted to be numbered among her friends; and in a score
of little delicate sentences he conveyed to her his appreciation of her conduct
in marrying a man whom she loved, in spite of the opposition of her friends, his
respect for her husband's character and talents, and his desire to serve them.
Then he turned the conversation upon Mrs. Schröder; and Barbara noticed that his
manner changed; that he hesitated, and kept his eyes down, as he wondered
whether she were happy; whether she loved he husband; whether it had really been
her duty to obey her father's will, and not consult her own inclinations, as
people said had been the case. For the first time a light broke upon Barbara,
and she knew Captain Lyster's story as plainly as if he had told it to her in so
many words. Following his glance as he stopped speaking, she saw that it rested
on Alice Schröder, to whom Mr. Beresford was now talking, bending over her chair
with great apparent devotion; and looking from them to Mr. Schröder, Barbara
remarked that the gloom had returned to his face, while Frank Churchill himself
looked somewhat annoyed.</p>
<p>It was not without a very great deal of trouble that Mr. Pringle had induced
his friend Prescott to accompany him to Saxe-Coburg Square. Even after that
gentleman had given a reluctant consent he withdrew it, and on the very morning
of the reception Mr. Pringle was not aware whether or not he should have to go
alone. For Mr. Prescott was very much in love with Kate Mellon still: that
interview in the Park had by no means had the effect of curing him of his
passion; although, being a sensible young fellow, he saw that there was not the
slightest use in giving way to it.</p>
<p>&quot;He's a thoroughly changed buffer, is Jim, sir!&quot; Mr. Pringle would remark of
him; &quot;he used to be the cheeriest of birds; always good for going out some
where, and no end of fun; always in tip-top spirits, and the best chap out. But
now he sits in his chambers, and smokes his pipe, and grizzles himself to death,
pretty near; wishing he'd got more money, and all sorts of things. That won't
do, you know! He must be picked up and trotted out; and the man for that line of
business is yours truly.&quot; In pursuance of which determination Mr. Pringle opened
a system of attack on his friend, and in the first place insisted that they
should go together to Mr. Schröder's reception. Even at the last, when Prescott
gave in his final consent, it was under strong protest. &quot;I shall be dreary, old
boy; and you'll be sorry you took me. You know I'm not very good company just
now, George. I've not got over--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All right; I know. 'Tell me, my heart, can this be?' &amp;c. But we'll have some
dinner at Simpson's, and a bottle of old port; and that'll set you up, and make
you see life under a different aspect, as they say in novels.&quot;</p>
<p>The dinner was very good; and finding his friend still silent and
low-spirited, Mr. Pringle exerted himself to rouse him. He was very well known
at the dining-rooms, and called the waiters by their Christian names, and asked
after their families, and little events in their private lives.</p>
<p>Mr. Prescott could not help laughing at the absurdities perpetrated by his
friend, and gradually his spirits revived. After dinner they went to Mr.
Pringle's chambers, and smoked and had some hot whisky-and-water, which, coming
after the port-wine, had a very hilarious effect upon Mr. Pringle, who then
wanted to &quot;go out some where,&quot; and not to go to the Schröders at all; but Mr.
Prescott overruling this, they dressed and went. Mr. Pringle--and especially Mr.
Pringle after half a bottle of port-wine and a couple of tumblers of
whisky-punch--was a trying person to go about with, and Prescott had to call him
to order several times. When they arrived at the house, and were asked their
names, he gave them as the Duke of Wellington and Mr. Babbage; and on the
servant's being about gravely to repeat them, he stopped him, saying they did
not wish their names announced, as they were detectives come on very private
business. On the staircase he feigned a wild terror at the powdered heads of the
footmen; asked &quot;how they came so white;&quot; by nature or not? and altogether so
behaved himself, that Mr. Prescott declared he would not enter the room with
him.</p>
<p>Once in the room, Mr. Pringle toned down visibly, and conducted himself like
an ordinary mortal. He was very friendly with Alice Schröder, and expressed
poignant regret at Mr. Townshend's sudden indisposition (for that worthy
gentleman declined to come upstairs after dinner; Beresford's mention of Pigott
and Wells had been too much for him), though secretly Mr. Pringle was pleased at
missing his godfather, whom he was accustomed to regard as the essence of
sternness; and he was introduced to Churchill, of whom he spoke the next day at
the office as a &quot;deuced clever fellow, a literary bird;&quot; and he listened for a
few minutes to Klavierspieler's pianoforte-fireworks; and, then went down and
got some refreshment. He endeavoured to induce Mr. Prescott to accompany him;
but that gentleman not merely absolutely declined, but addressed his friend in
strong words of warning, and declared that as for himself he was thoroughly
happy where he was.</p>
<p>Indeed, once more in society, surrounded by well-looking, well-dressed
people, listening to music and conversation in a splendidly-appointed home, Mr.
Prescott began to think to himself that the solitary pipe-smokings in dreary
chambers, the shutting himself away from the world, and giving himself up to
melancholy, was rather a mistake. Of course the grand cause of it all remained
unaltered,--he never could get over his passion, he never would give up thinking
of Kate,--and just then he started as he heard a light, musical, girlish voice
behind him say, &quot;it is James Prescott!&quot; He turned rapidly round, and saw two or
three people standing by him; one of whom, a very pretty, fresh-coloured buxom
girl, stepped forward, laughed as he made a rather distant bow, and said, &quot;You
don't recollect me! Oh, what a horridly bad compliment!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is excessively absurd, to be sure, on my part, I know. I cannot, by Jove!
Emily Murray!&quot; Prescott burst out as the face recurred to his memory.</p>
<p>&quot;Emily Murray, of course!&quot; said the young lady, still laughing; &quot;Why, what
ages since we've met! not since you left Havering; and how's the dear Vicar and
the girls? which of them are married? I should so like to see them; and
you--you're in some Government Office we heard; which is it? and--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I must come to Mr. Prescott's rescue, Emily, if you'll introduce me. You've
stunned him with questions,&quot; said an elderly lady standing by.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, aunt, how can you say so! James--Mr. Prescott,--I don't know which I
ought to say; but I always used to say James,--this is my aunt, Mrs. Wilmslow,
with whom we're staying. I say we, for papa is in town; but his gout was
threatening; so he wouldn't come to-night.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My brother will be very pleased to see you, though, Mr. Prescott,&quot; said Mrs.
Wilmslow; &quot;I know he has the kindliest recollection of your father at Havering.
Will you come and lunch with us to-morrow?&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Prescott accepted with thanks, and Mrs. Wilmslow moved back to her party;
but Emily Murray stayed behind, and they had a very long conversation; during
which he settled not merely that he would lunch in Portland Place on the next
day, but that he would afterwards accompany Miss Murray and some of her friends
in their subsequent ride. As Miss Murray departed with her friends, Mr. Pringle
came up and apologised for having left his friend so much alone. &quot;Very sorry,
old fellow, but I got into an argument with an old German buffer downstairs.
Very good fellow, but spoke very shy English. Told me he was nearly eighty years
old; and that he accounted for his good health by having been always in the
habit of taking a walk past dinner. Took me full ten minutes to find out he
meant <i>after</i> dinner. But I say, old fellow, I'm really sorry; you must
have had a very slow evening.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;On the contrary,&quot; said Mr. Prescott, &quot;I've enjoyed myself amazingly.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Pringle looked hard at his friend, and whistled plaintively.</p>

<h4><a name="div1_19" href="#div1Ref_19">CHAPTER XIX.</a></h4>
<h5>THE OLD OR THE NEW?</h5>
<br>
<p>Thirty years before the date of my story, Braxton Murray and Alan Prescott
were college friends. Braxton was a gentleman commoner of Christchurch; Alan, a
scholar of Wadham. Braxton had four hundred a-year allowance from his father,
and the direct succession to one of the richest estates in Kent. Alan had his
scholarship, seventy pounds a-year exhibition from a country foundation-school,
and another fifty allowed him by his uncle. The disparity between the positions
of the two young men was vast, but they were thoroughly attached to each other;
and when Braxton had succeeded his father, and the old vicar of Havering died,
Braxton Murray sent for Alan Prescott, then doing duty as a curate and usher in
a suburban school, and presented him with the vicarage of Havering. That was a
happy time in both their lives; the income of the Vicar was small, certainly,
but so was the parish, and the duties were light; and having only himself, his
wife, and a son and daughter to provide for, and being constantly in the receipt
of presents from his friend and patron, the Rev. Alan Prescott did very well
indeed. Situate in the heart of Kent, no prettier spot than Havering can be
found; and Brooklands, the squire's place, is the gem of the county. In the
bay-window of the old dining-room, overhanging the fertile valley through which
the Medway lies like a thread of silver, the two men would sit drinking their
claret, discussing old university chums or topics of the day, and pausing
occasionally to look at the gambols of the Vicar's son, Jim, and the Squire's
only daughter, Emily, who were the merriest of little lovers. But as years went
by, and the Vicar's family steadily increased,--first by twin girls, then by a
bouncing boy, and finally by a little crippled girl,--and as, each year,
expenses grew heavier, Alan Prescott was somewhat put to it to obtain the
necessary connexion of those two ends, the means of bringing which together
puzzles so many of us all our lives; and when the governors of the
foundation-school where he had been usher, remembering his abilities, wrote to
offer him the vacant headmastership, he was too poor to refuse it. Duff borough,
a big, staring, gaunt, manufacturing town, perched on one of the bleakest of the
northern hills, was a bad exchange for beaming little Havering, with its smiling
orchards and glorious hop-gardens; and the society of the purse-proud, cold,
stuck-up calico-men was heartbreaking after the ease and warmth of Braxton
Murray's companionship. But Alan Prescott felt the spurs of need, and buckled to
his work like a man. An active correspondence was kept up between him and the
Squire of Havering; and occasionally,--once in the course of four or five years,
perhaps,--he had spent a week at Brooklands; but it was too expensive to remove
his family; and consequently, until that evening in Saxe-Coburg Square James
Prescott had not seen Emily Murray since they were children together, playing
out in the old dining-room at Brooklands.</p>
<p>Emily Murray had been a pretty child; had become a beautiful girl. There was
no doubt about her; one look into those honest brown eyes would have convinced
you that she was thorough. A plump rosy-rounded bud of woman; a thoroughly
English girl, void of affectation, conceit, and trickery; clean, clear, honest,
wholesome, and loving. As she talked to James Prescott of the old days at
Havering, she spoke out freely, referring to bygone gambols and fun with frank
laughter and many a humorous reminiscence; and when she suggested his joining
their riding-party the next day, she looked him straight in the face without the
smallest shadow of entanglement or guile. To her own brother her manner had not
been different, Prescott thought, as, after they had parted, he recalled every
word, every glance; and he wished for a moment that there had been something
different in it, a trifle more tenderness, a hand-pressure, a sly upward glance,
or--and then he flung such nonsense behind him, and was delighted to remember
the warmth of her recognition, the cheeriness of her chat. She was nothing to
him, of course; his doom was fixed; he had loved, and--and yet how pretty she
was! how perfectly gloved! how charmingly dressed! what a pleasure it was to
feel that you were talking to a lady! to know that no slanginess would offend
the eye, no questionable <i>argot</i> grate upon the ear; to feel that--and then
Mr. Prescott remembered how the idol of his soul had called him &quot;Jim,&quot; ay, and
&quot;old buffer;&quot; how she had smoked cigars, and used maledictions towards
refractory animals; how there had been all kinds of odd discussions about all
kinds of odd people before her; and how he had seen men take wine without stint,
and smoke cigars in her face, and wear their bats before her, without the
smallest self-restraint. And, smoking a final pipe before turning into bed, Mr.
Prescott pondered on these things long and earnestly.</p>
<br>
<p>Mr. Prescott found a warm welcome awaiting him. Mrs. Wilmslow had been
impressed with his manners and appearance, and old Mr. Murray had a yearning for
the friend of his youth, and longed to receive that friend's son with open arms.
A hale pleasant gentleman, Mr. Murray, with that wonderful cleanliness which is
never seen out of England, with polished bald head fringed with iron-gray hair,
ruddy complexion, keen little blue eyes, and brilliant teeth. He wore a slipper
on his right foot, but hobbled forward, nevertheless, and gave the young man a
hearty shake of the hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Glad to see you, Jim! Little Jim you were; but, by Jove! I should not like
to carry you on my back now, as I have done many a time. Very glad to see you!
Old times come again, by George! Trace every feature of your face, and can
almost see Magdalen tower behind your back--you're so like your father. How's
the Vicar, eh? I'll drag him out of that infernal spinning-jenny place yet, and
give him a breather across the home-copse at Havering before next season's
over.&quot;</p>
<p>Prescott said that his father was well and jolly, but scarcely up to shooting
now, he had had so little practice lately.</p>
<p>&quot;So much the more reason we should give it him, then! He used to be a crack
shot; one of the few men I've seen shoot a brace of woodcock right and left! And
walk! by George, he'd walk me into--has he had any gout?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not yet, sir;--a threatening last year.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bravo!&quot; roared the old gentleman; &quot;I've got some 20-port that shall bring
that threatening to real effect, if he'll only drink enough of it. And to think
that Pussy should have found you out!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pussy?&quot; said Mr. Prescott.</p>
<p>&quot;Emily, of course! a wayward gentle puss who never shows her claws!&quot; and at
that moment Emily entered the room, and advanced towards Prescott with frank
smile and outstretched hand.</p>
<p>Luncheon passed off pleasantly enough. The old gentleman rattled on
incessantly, and availed himself of Prescott's presence, and Mrs. Wilmslow's
distracted attention consequent thereupon, to take three bumpers of dry sherry,
instead of that one half-glass to which, by doctor's orders, he was so strictly
relegated. Mrs. Wilmslow was thoroughly charmed with Prescott, led him on to
talk of his home-life, of his office friends, and seemed to regard him with real
interest. Emily was less talkative than she had been the previous evening, and
seldom looked up from the table; but she joined readily in the conversation, and
none were too pleased when the horses were announced.</p>
<p>&quot;Got a horse, Jim?&quot; asked the Squire. &quot;That's right! hope it'll carry you all
right, though one never knows any thing about these hired hacks. You might have
ridden the cob, if I'd known you'd been coming earlier! This is his third day's
rest, and the cob will be about as fresh as paint when I get across him again.
Not that I care much for your Rotten-Row riding--dull work that, up and down, up
and down! The Vicar and I--we used to go to work in a little more business-like
fashion than that! I suppose he never gets a day's run now? Ah! thought not!
Those spinning-jenny locals would think it unprofessional for a parson to follow
hounds, eh? There, bless you, pussy! good-by, child! and good-by to you, young
Jim! Call here again in a day or two, and we'll settle about your coming to
Havering in the vacation--and the Vicar too, d'ye hear?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm getting rather nervous about my responsibility, Miss Murray,&quot; said
Prescott, as they passed through into the hall. &quot;I don't think I've forgotten my
old knack of mounting. You needn't fear my not lifting you high enough, or
jerking you over the side, I mean; but I've never seen your amazonship yet, and
if any thing should happen--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, don't fear that, James--Mr. Prescott, I mean!&quot; said Emily with a clear
ringing laugh. &quot;You'll mount me rightly enough, I know: and as for looking after
me afterwards, I forgot to tell you my riding-mistress would be with us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your riding-mistress!&quot; but as he spoke, the footman threw open the
street-door; and the first thing that met his glance was a well-known figure
sitting erect on a black thoroughbred. Kate Mellon! no one else. James Prescott
had watched too often the rounded outline of that compact figure, the fall of
that dark-blue skirt, the <i>pose</i> of that neat little chimney-pot hat, under
which the gold-shot hair was massed in a clump behind, not to recognise them all
at the first glance. Kate Mellon, by all that was marvellous! Two young ladies,
also mounted, were with her; and a groom was leading another horse, with a
side-saddle on it for Emily Murray, and another groom was leading the very
presentable hack which Prescott had engaged from Allen's. As she caught sight of
Prescott, Kate gave one little scarcely-perceptible start, and then saluted Miss
Murray with uplifted whip. Prescott swung Emily to her saddle, and the cavalcade
started.</p>
<p>&quot;You see I have brought a cavalier, Miss Mellon,&quot; said Emily, with a smile;
&quot;though I don't know whether such an encumbrance is permissible; but this is Mr.
Prescott, whom I have known for a very long time. James, this is Miss Mellon,
who is good enough to superintend my clumsiness on horseback, and who is the
very star of horsewomen herself.&quot;</p>
<p>Kate started a little at the &quot;James,&quot; but merely repeated the whip
salutation, and said, &quot;Mr. Prescott and I have met before, Miss Murray. Besides,
you're coming it too strong about yourself! you're quite able to take care of
yourself now, and have no clumsiness left, whatever you might have had at first.
This has relieved me of some of my charge; for these two young ladies will want
all my eyes, and another to spare, if I had it. Perhaps you'll not mind my
riding forward with them, and you and Mr. Prescott can follow us; you're both of
you to be trusted--with your horses, I mean!&quot; and she smiled shortly, and
cantering on, joined the anonymous young ladies in front.</p>
<p>You see it is perfectly right to tell a man who is desperately smitten with
you that he is on the wrong tack; that though you have a great regard for him as
a friend, you cannot reciprocate his love-passion; and that the whole affair is
ill-judged, and should properly be put a stop to at once. But when you come upon
him suddenly, within three weeks, evidently consoling himself by dangling at the
heels of another woman--well, there is something provoking in it, to say the
least! Kate Mellon was thoroughly honest during all that last interview with
Prescott in Rotten Row, but she scarcely expected <i>this</i>.</p>
<p>So they rode on in two divisions; and the young ladies in front, who were the
daughters of a picture-dealer who had recently risen from nothing, and who were
in the greatest state of fright at the unaccustomed exercise, were surprised to
find a tone of asperity at first tinging their mistress's instructions at being
told of their rounded shoulders and their heavy hands, in far plainer terms than
had been hitherto employed. But this severity gradually subsided as they went
on, and as Kate thought to herself how all was for the best, and how, instead of
being annoyed, she ought to do every thing she could to help the fortunes of one
who had been so staunchly gallant to her, until he was repulsed. As for the
couple behind, they got on splendidly; Emily looked to the greatest advantage on
horseback; and Prescott could scarcely take his eyes from her as he watched the
graceful manner in which she sat her horse, and as he listened to the
encomiastic remarks which her appearance extracted from the passers-by. He
talked to her of the old days, and she answered without an ounce of coquetry or
affectation; and she spoke of her father, of her happiness in her home, of the
little simple duties and pleasures in their village, and of other little
suchlike matters, in an honest way that touched James Prescott deeply, and sent
purer, calmer thoughts into his heart than had found lodging there for many
months.</p>
<p>After a couple of hours in the Row the party returned to Mrs. Wilmslow's,
where Emily bade them farewell, and Prescott also alighted, giving up his horse
to the groom waiting for it. Kate Mellon saw her other pupils to their home
close by, and then turned into the Row again, intending to have one final gallop
on her way to The Den. She was at full speed when she heard the dull thud of a
horse's hoofs close behind her, and turning saw Mr. Simnel. In a minute he was
by her side.</p>
<p>&quot;How d'ye do, Kate?&quot; said he, reining-in his big hunter; &quot;I came on the
chance of seeing you here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How do, Simnel?&quot; said Miss Mellon, shortly; &quot;what do you want?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I want you to say when I can come up to The Den and have half-an-hour's chat
with you, Kate.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And I tell you, never! as I've told you before. Look here, Simnel,&quot; said
she, pulling up short; &quot;let's have this out now. I don't like you; I never did,
and I never shall! and I don't want you at my place. Do you understand?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Perfectly,&quot; said Simnel, with a hard smile; &quot;and yet I think I must come. I
want to say something specially particular to you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What about? What you've said before? About yourself?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Simnel, smiling as before; &quot;I never say things twice over. I want
to talk to you about a friend of ours--Charles Beresford.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Charles Beresford?--what of him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's just what I propose to come and tell you.&quot;</p>
<p>Their eyes met. The next instant Kate cast hers down as she said, &quot;I shall be
at home on Friday from two till six. You can come then.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You may depend on me,&quot; said Simnel; &quot;I'll not bore you any longer.&quot; He
raised his hat with perfect politeness, turned his horse, and rode slowly away.</p>

<h5>THE CHURCHILLS AT HOME.</h5>
<br>
<p>Three months' experience sufficiently indoctrinated Barbara Churchill into
her new life. At the end of that time she could scarcely have been recognised as
the Barbara Lexden who had held her own for three seasons, and done undisputed
havoc among the detrimentals: not that she was changed in appearance; that grand
<i>hauteur</i>, that indefinable something of delicacy, breeding, and
refinement, was even more noticeable than ever; if any thing, her nostrils were
more frequently expanded, her lips more constantly in their curve; nor had her
eyes lost their brightness, her figure its trim form, her walk its grace and
elegance. Though Parker had long since served under another mistress Barbara's
hair had never been more artistically arranged than by her own hands; and though
her dress had been modified from the nearest approach to excess in the
prevailing fashion which good taste would permit to the merest simplicity, she
had never, even in the height of her queendom, been more becomingly attired than
in the plain silk dresses and simple linen collars and cuffs which she donned in
Great Adullam Street. Where was the change, then? whence the source of the
alteration? In truth she herself could scarcely tell; or if the idea ever rose
in her mind she thrust it out instantly, arguing within herself, in a thousand
unimpressive, undecisive, unsatisfactory ways, that she did <i>not</i> feel as
she had imagined, and that she was merely &quot;a little low.&quot;</p>
<p>That phrase was Frank Churchill's bane. He would return from the <i>Statesman</i>
Office, where, after the regular daily consultation, he had remained and written
his leader (Harding always hitherto had managed to free his friend from
night-work), and would find his wife with red-rimmed eyelids and the final
traces of a past shower. At first he was frightened at these manifestations,
would tenderly caress her, and ask her what had happened, Nothing! always
nothing! no cross, no domestic anxiety, no special trouble. But then something
must have happened. Frank's logical spirit, long trained, refused to accept an
effect without a cause; and at length, after repeated questioning, he would
learn from Barbara that she was &quot;a little low&quot; that day. A little low! What on
earth had she had to be a little low about? And then Frank would imagine that
there were more things in women than were dreamt of in his philosophy; and would
pet her and coax her during dinner, and restore her somewhat to herself, until
he took up his review or his heavy reading, when the &quot;little low&quot; fit would come
on again; and after half an hour's contemplation of the coals Barbara would
burst into sobs and retire to bed. And then Frank, laying down his book and
pondering over his final pipe, would first begin to think that he was badly
treated; to review his conduct, and see whether any act of his during the day
could have caused the &quot;little lowness;&quot; to imagine that Barbara was making
mountains of molehills, and was losing that spirit which had been one great
attraction to him; then gradually he would soften, would take into consideration
the changes in the circumstances of her life; would begin to accuse himself of
neglecting her, and preferring his reading at a time when she had a fair claim
on his attention; and would finally rush off to implore her forgiveness, and pet
her more than ever.</p>
<p>An infatuated fellow, this Frank Churchill; so happy in the possession of his
wife, in the knowledge that she was his own, all his own, that nothing, not even
the fact that she was occasionally a &quot;little low,&quot; had power to damp his
happiness for more than a very few minutes. He would sit at dinner of an
evening, when she was engaged with her work, and he had a book in front of him,
in company, when he could steal a minute from the general conversation, looking
at her in rapt admiration; not one point of her beauty was lost upon him; the
shape of her head; its <i>pose</i> on her neck; her delicate hands with that
pink shell-like palm; those long tapering fingers and filbert nails; her rounded
bust and slim waist,--all her special excellences impressed him more now than
they had when he had first seen her; but, above all, he revelled in her &quot;bred&quot;
appearance, in that indefinable something which seemed to lift her completely
out of the set of people with which he saw her surrounded, and to show her by
right the denizen of another sphere. If you could have persuaded Frank Churchill
that another man held such opinions as these; that another man had such feelings
with regard to his wife; and that through holding them he was induced to regard
somewhat intolerantly those among whom he had hitherto moved, and from whom he
had received the greatest kindness and friendship,--what words would have been
scathing enough to have expressed Frank Churchill's disgust!</p>
<p>Yet such was undoubtedly the case. Churchill's most intimate friend was
George Harding,--a man whom he reverenced and looked up to, but whom he, since
his marriage, had often found himself pitying from the bottom of his soul. Not
on his own account: loyal to his craft and steadfast in his friendship,
Churchill thought there were few more desirable positions than the editorship of
the <i>Statesman</i>, when as free from influence or partisanship as when
Harding held the berth. It was because his friend was Mrs. Harding's husband
that Churchill pitied him; though, indeed, Mrs. Harding was a very fair average
kind of woman. A dowdy little person, Mrs. Harding! the daughter of a snuffy
Welsh rector, who had written a treatise on &quot;Aorists,&quot; and with whom Harding had
read one long vacation,--a round-faced old-maidish little woman, classically
brought up, who could construe Cicero fluently, and looked upon Horace (Q.
Flaccus, I mean) as rather a loose personage. In the solitude of Plas-y-dwdllem,
George Harding was thrown into the society of this young female. He did not fall
in love with her--they were neither of them capable of any thing violent of that
nature; but--I am reduced to the phraseology of the servants' hall to express my
meaning--they &quot;kept company together;&quot; and when George took his degree and
started in life as leader-writer for the <i>Morning Cracker</i> (long since
defunct), he thought the best thing he could do for his comfort was to go for a
run to Wales and bring back Sophia Evans as his wife. This he did; and they had
lived thoroughly happily ever since. Mrs. Harding believed intensely in the <i>
Statesman</i>; read it every day, from the title to the printer's name; knew the
name of every contributor, and could tell who had done what at a glance. Her
great pride in going out was to take one of the cards sent to the office, and
observe the effect it made upon the receiving attendant at operas, flower-shows,
or conversazioni. She always took care that the tickets for these last were sent
to her; and her head-dress of black-velvet bows with pearl-beads hanging down
behind was well to the fore whenever a mummy was unrolled, the fossil jawbone of
an antediluvian animal was descanted on, or some sallow missionary presented
himself at Burlington House, to be congratulated by hundreds of dreary people on
having escaped uneaten from some place to which he never ought to have gone. She
herself was fond of having occasionally what she called &quot;a social evening.&quot; This
recreation was held on a Saturday, when there was no work at the <i>Statesman</i>
office, when the principal members of the staff would be bidden, and when the
condiments provided would be brown-bread and butter rolled into <i>cornets</i>,
tea and coffee and lemonade, while the recreation consisted in conversation
(amongst men who had met for every night during the past twelve months), and in
examining photographs of the city of Prague. The ribald young men at the office
spoke of Mrs. Harding as &quot;Plutarch,&quot; a name given to her one night when Mr.
Slater, the dramatic critic, asked her what novel she was then reading, and she
replied, &quot;Novel, sir! Plutarch's Lives!&quot; But they all liked her,
notwithstanding; and for her sake and their dear old chief's did penitential
duty at the occasional &quot;social evenings&quot; in Decorum Street.</p>
<p>Of course this little body had nothing in common with Mrs. Frank Churchill,
and neither understood the other. George Harding had been so anxious that his
wife should pay all honour to his friend's bride, that Mrs. Harding's was the
first visit Barbara received. They did not study the laws of etiquette in
Mesopotamia, or Mrs. Harding thought she would break the ice of ceremony with a
friendly call; so the arrived one morning at 11 A.M. dressed for the occasion,
and having sent up her card, awaited Barbara's advent in the drawing-room. No
sooner had the servant shut the door and Mrs. Harding found herself alone than
she minutely examined the furniture, saw where new things had replaced others
with which she had been acquainted, mentally appraised the new carpet, and took
stock generally. The result was not satisfactory; an anti-macassar which Barbara
had been braiding lay on the table, with the needle still in it. Mrs. Harding
took it up between her finger and thumb, gazed at it contemptuously, and
pronounced it &quot;fal-lal;&quot; she peeped into the leaves of a book lying open on the
sofa, and shut them up with a sigh of &quot;Novels! ah!&quot; she turned over the music
lying on the little cottage-piano which Frank had hired for his wife, and again
shrugged her shoulders with an exclamation of distaste. Then she sat herself
down on a low chair with her back to the light (an old campaigner, Mrs. Harding,
and seldom to be taken at a disadvantage), pulled out and smoothed her dress all
round her, settled her ribbons, made a further incursion into the territories of
a refractory thumb in her cowskin puce-coloured glove, which had hitherto
refused submission to the invader, and awaited the coming of her hostess.</p>
<p>She had not long to wait. Frank had gone out on business; but he had so often
spoken of Harding as his dear friend, that Barbara, though by no means gushing
by nature,--indeed, if truth must be told, somewhat proud and reserved,--had
made up her mind to be specially friendly to Mrs. Harding; so she came sailing
into the room with outstretched hand and a smile on her face. Mrs. Harding gave
one glance at the full flowing figure, the rustling skirts, and the outstretched
hand; she acknowledged the superior presence, and then suddenly maxims learned
in her youth in the still seclusion of Plas-y-dwdllem rose in her mind,--maxims
which inculcated a severe and uncompromising deportment as the very acme of good
breeding. So, instead of coming forward to meet Barbara and responding to her
apparent warmth, the little woman stood up for a quarter of a minute, crossed
her hands before her, bowed, and sank into her seat again. For an instant
Barbara stopped, and flushed to the roots her hair; then, quickly perceiving it
was merely ignorance which had caused this strange proceeding on Mrs. Harding's
part, she advanced and seated herself near her visitor.</p>
<p>&quot;You are a stranger in this neighbourhood?&quot; commenced Mrs. Harding.</p>
<p>Barbara, feeling that the admission would be what policemen call &quot;used
against her,&quot; answered in the affirmative.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very healthy,&quot; said Mrs. Harding.</p>
<p>Barbara again assented.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you like it?&quot; asked Mrs. Harding.</p>
<p>&quot;I can scarcely say. I have had so little opportunity of judging. It is very
convenient for where my husband has to go, and all that; but it is a long way
from that part of London which I know.&quot;</p>
<p>Two or three things in this innocently-intended speech jarred dreadfully on
Mrs. Harding's feelings. That worthy matron had all the blood of Ap-somebody, a
tremendously consonanted personage of Plas-y-dwdllem in old times, and she was
irritable in the highest degree. But she made a great gulp at her rage, and only
said, &quot;Oh, you mean the <i>Statesman</i> office; yes, of course I ought to know
where that is, considering Mr. Harding's position there! We think this a very
nice situation; but, of course, when you've been brought up in Grosvenor Square,
it's different! What does Vokins charge you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I--I beg your pardon!&quot; said Barbara. &quot;Vokins?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes; Vokins the butcher!&quot; repeated the energetic little woman. &quot;Sevenpence
or sevenpence-halfpenny for legs? Your mother-in-law was the only woman in the
neighbourhood who got 'em for sevenpence, and I'm most anxious to know whether
he hasn't raised it since you came here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sorry I'm unable to answer you,&quot; said Barbara; &quot;but hitherto my husband
has paid the tradesmen's bills. I've no doubt&quot; she added, with a half-sneer,
&quot;that it shows great shortcomings on my part; but it is the fact. I have hopes
that I shall improve as I go on.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, no doubt,&quot; said Mrs. Harding, faintly. &quot;Live and learn, you know.&quot; But
she gave up Barbara Churchill from that time out. She, who had known the price
of every article of domestic consumption since she was fourteen years old, and
had fought innumerable hand-to-hand combats with extortionate tradesmen, looked
upon this <i>insouciance</i> of Barbara's as any thing but a venial crime. A few
other topics were started, feebly entered into, and dropped; and then Mrs.
Harding took her leave, with faintly-expressed hopes of seeing her new-made
acquaintance soon again.</p>
<p>That afternoon George Harding, returning home to dinner, was told by his wife
that she had called on Mrs. Churchill.</p>
<p>&quot;Ay!&quot; said the honest old boy; &quot;and what did you make of her, Sophy? I'd
trust your judgment in a thousand; and Frank has a high opinion of it, I know.
Is she pretty, and clever, and managing, and all the rest of it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, as to prettiness, George, she's not one of my style of beauties,&quot; said
Mrs. Harding. &quot;She's a tall slip of a woman, with straight features, such as you
see on the old coins; and she's very stand-offish in her manners; and, as to
managing--well, she's too fine a lady to know her tradespeople's names, or what
she pays them.&quot;</p>
<p>George Harding whistled softly, and then plunged into his hashed mutton. He
made but one remark, but that he repeated twice. &quot;I told him to beware of
swells. God knows I warned him. I told him to beware of swells.&quot;</p>
<p>That same night Mrs. Churchill told her husband of the visit she had had.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm so glad!&quot; said Frank. &quot;I knew old George would send his wife first.
Well, what do you think of Mrs. Harding, Barbara?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I've no doubt she meant every thing kindly, Frank,&quot; said Barbara,
&quot;She's--she's a right-meaning kind of woman, Frank, no doubt; but she's--she's
not my style, you know.&quot;</p>
<p>Frank was dashed. &quot;I don't exactly understand, dear. She was perfectly
friendly?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, perfectly! But she asked me all sorts of curious questions about the
tradespeople, and the housekeeping, and that. So strange, you know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I confess I don't see any thing strange so far. She offered you the benefit
of her experience, did she? Well, that was kind; and what was wanted, I think.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I'm sorry you think it was wanted,&quot; said Barbara. &quot;I didn't think any
thing had gone wrong in the house.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, my darling, of course not,&quot; said Frank &quot;nothing--all is quite right.
But, you know, housekeeping is Mrs. Harding's strong point; and young beginners
like ourselves might learn from her with advantage. I think we must lay
ourselves out for instruction in several matters, Barbara darling, from such
persons as Mrs. Harding and my mother.&quot;</p>
<p>And Barbara said, &quot;Oh, yes, of course.&quot; And Frank did not notice that her
little shoulders went up, and the corners of her little mouth went down, and her
eyes sparkled in a manner which did not promise much docility on the part of one
of the pupils thus to be instructed.</p>
<p>It took but a very short time for Barbara to discover that she and her
mother-in-law were not likely to be the very best friends. On their first
meeting the old lady was very much overcome, and welcomed her new
daughter-in-law in all fulness of heart. And perhaps--though Barbara never knew
it--it was at this first meeting that a feeling of disappointment was engendered
in Mrs. Churchill's heart. For long brooding over the forthcoming events of that
day, ere the new-married couple had returned to town, Mrs. Churchill had settled
in her own mind that there were to be no jealousies between her and the new
importation into the small family circle as to the possession of Frank, and that
to that end the right plan would be to receive Barbara as her daughter, and to
make her part recipient of that affection which had hitherto only been lavished
on Frank. This idea she forthwith carried into execution, kissing Barbara with
great warmth, and addressing her as her dear child. Unimpulsive Barbara, though
really pleased at her reception, accepted the caresses with becoming dignity,
offered her cheek for the old lady's warm salute, and addressed her
mother-in-law in tones which, though by no means lacking in reverence, certainly
had no superfluity of love. The old lady noticed it, and ascribed it to
timidity, or the natural shyness of a young girl in a strange position; she
noticed specially that Barbara invariably spoke to and of her as &quot;Mrs.
Churchill;&quot; and before they parted she said:</p>
<p>&quot;My dear, you surely don't always intend to speak to me in that formal
manner. I am your mother now, Barbara; won't you call me so?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, dear Mrs. Churchill--no, if you please! I have never called any one by
that name since I lost my own mother, and--and I cannot do so, indeed.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Churchill simply said, &quot;Very well, my dear.&quot; But in what afterwards
became a gaping wound, this may be looked upon as the first abrasion of the
skin. That gave the old lady a notion that her daughter-in-law's tactics were to
be purely defensive, that there was to be no compromise, and that she, the old
lady, was clearly to understand that her position was on the other side of the
gabions and the fascines, the stone walls and the broad moat; that by no means
was the key of the citadel to be considered as in her possession.</p>
<p>When relations of this kind in one family begin to be <i>à tort et à travers</i>,
there is no end to the horrible complications arising out of them. Mrs.
Churchill attempted to initiate Barbara into the mysteries of housekeeping, and
the art of successfully combating nefarious tradesmen; but the success which
attended the old lady's efforts may be guessed from Barbara's interview with
Mrs. Harding. She tried to get Barbara to walk out with her; but Barbara had not
been accustomed to walk in London streets, and was timid at crossings,--which
made the old lady irate; and was frightened at the way in which men stared, and
on some occasions spoke out unreservedly their opinions of her beauty. She had
liked the outspoken admiration of the crowd, as she sat well forward in the
carriage on drawing-room days; but then she knew that she had Jeames with his
long cane in reserve in case of need; though I doubt whether Jeames would have
been more useful in case of actual attack than old Mrs. Churchill, who
invariably resented these unsolicited compliments to her daughter-in-law with a
snort of defiance, and who usually carried a stout umbrella with a ferule at the
end, which would have made a very awkward weapon, and which she would have
wielded with right good will. Misunderstandings were constant: after the first
few occasions of their meeting, Barbara did not ask Mrs. Churchill to the house
for fear of appearing formal; whereupon the old lady, when Frank called at her
lodgings, asked what she had done to be exiled from her son's house. Pacified
and settled as to this point, the old lady, to show her forgiveness, called in
so frequently, that Barbara told her husband she knew her housekeeping was not
perfection; but that she had not expected a system of <i>espionnage</i>, which
was evidently kept on her by his mother. When Mrs. Churchill dined at their
house, Barbara, for fear of appearing extravagant, would have a very simple
joint and pudding; whereupon the old lady would afterwards tell Mrs. Harding, or
some other friend, that &quot;Heaven alone knew where Frank's money went--not on
their dinners, my dear, for they're positively mean.&quot;</p>
<p>Nor with her husband's friends did Barbara make a very favourable impression.
They admired her, of course; to withhold that tribute was impossible; but they
were so utterly different in manner and expression, had such different topics of
conversation and such totally opposite opinions to any thing she had ever seen
or heard, that she sat in silence before them; uttered vague and irrational
replies to questions put to her while her thoughts were far away, smiled feebly
at wrong times, and so conducted herself, that Mr. M'Malthus, a clever
Scotchman, who was worming his way into literature, and was at that time getting
a name for blunt offensive sayings (an easily earned capital, on which many a
man has lived for years), was reported to have remarked that &quot;a prettier woman
or bigger fool than Mrs. Churchill was not often seen.&quot;</p>
<p>There were others who, while they allowed that she had plenty of common-sense
(and indeed on occasion, in a cut-and-thrust argument, Barbara showed herself
cunning of fence, and by no means deficient in repartee), would call her
stuck-up and proud; and there were some, indeed, who repudiated the mere fact of
her having lived in a different class of society to which they were not
admitted, as in itself an insult and a shame. And even those who were disposed
to soften all defects and to exaggerate all virtues--and they were by no means
few in number--failed to what they call &quot;get on&quot; with the new Mrs. Churchill.
They had no subjects of conversation in common; for even when literary subjects
were introduced, they frightened Barbara by their iconoclastic tendencies;
deliberately smashing up all those gods whom she had hitherto been accustomed to
reverence, and erecting in their stead images inscribed with names unknown to
her, or known but to be shuddered at as owned by Radicals or free-thinkers. They
were men who outraged none of the social <i>convénances</i> of life; about whose
manner or behaviour no direct complaint could be made; and often she thought
herself somewhat exacting when she would repeat to herself, as she would--oh,
how often!--that they were not gentlemen: not her style of gentlemen; that is to
say, not the style of men to whom she had been accustomed. When, for instance,
would a man have dared to address his conversation to any other man in
preference to her, she being present? When could a man have permitted her to
open a door, or place a chair for herself, in that set amongst which she had
previously moved? Respect her! Her husband's friends would ignore her presence;
saying in reply to a remark from her, &quot;Look here, Churchill, you understand
this;&quot; or would prevent her interrupting them (a favourite practice of hers) by
putting up their hands and saying, &quot;Pardon-me while I state my case,&quot; continue
their argument in the most dogged manner.</p>
<p>What most amazed Barbara was the calm manner in which all her sallies,
however bitter or savage, were received by her husband's intimates, and laughed
away or glossed over by Frank himself. At first her notion was to put down these
persons by a calm haughty superiority or a studied reticence, which should in
itself have the effect of showing her opinion of them: but neither demeanour had
the smallest effect on those whom it was intended to reprove. The first time she
ever perceived that any one was the least degree inclined to oppose her sway or
dispute her authority, was one Saturday night, when Churchill's study was filled
with several of his old friends, smoking and chatting. Barbara was there too,
with her embroidery. She could stand tobacco-smoke perfectly; it did not give
her a headache, or even worse than that, redden her eyelids and make her wink;
and there was a small amount of &quot;fastness&quot; in it which pleased her. Moreover her
presence prevented the gathering in the <i>tabagie</i> from quite sinking into a
bachelor revel, the which Barbara, as a young married woman, held in the deepest
abomination. The conversation was in full swing about books, authors, and
publishers.</p>
<p>&quot;Chester's going to bring out a volume of poems,&quot; said Mr. Bloss, an amiable
young man with fluffy hair, who always had a good word for every one. &quot;Says he
should have published them before, but he's so many irons in the fire.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Better put his poems where his irons are,&quot; laughed Mr. Dunster, a merry
little old gentleman with light-blue eyes, who could take the skin off your back
and plant daggers in your heart, smiling all the time in the pleasantest manner.
&quot;Chester's next door to an idiot; lives close by you, by the way, Bloss, doesn't
he?&quot;</p>
<p>All the men laughed; and even Barbara, after a look of amazement, could not
help smiling.</p>
<p>&quot;He's dreadfully frightened of the critics,&quot; said another man sitting by.
&quot;You must notice him in the <i>Statesman</i> yourself, Churchill, eh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Or I'll speak to Harding. Poor Chester! he mustn't be allowed to come to
grief. What are his verses like? has any one seen them?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have,&quot; said Mr. Bloss. &quot;They're really--they're--well--they're not so very
bad, you know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What a burst of candour!&quot; said Mr. Dunster. &quot;Bloss, you are a young
reviewer, and I must caution you against such excessively strong statements.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Chester's most afraid of the <i>Scourge</i>,&quot; said the man who had spoken
before; &quot;he thinks it will flay him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He should mollify them by saying that his verses were written at 'an early
age,'&quot; laughed Churchill.</p>
<p>&quot;That wouldn't do for the <i>Scourge</i>; they would say the verses were too
bad even to have been written by a child in arms,&quot; said Mr. Dunster.</p>
<p>&quot;How <i>very</i> nice! What an old dear you are, Dunster!&quot; said a gentleman
sitting in a corner of the fireplace exactly opposite Barbara, with his legs
stretched out on a stool, and his body reclining on an easy-chair. This was Mr.
Lacy, an artist, who, as it was, made a very good income, but who might have
taken the highest rank had his perseverance been on a par with his talent; a
sleepy, dreamy man, with an intense appreciation of and regard for himself.</p>
<p>&quot;What do you think of all this, Mrs. Churchill?&quot; asked Bloss; &quot;they are any
thing but compassionate in their remarks.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They may be or not,&quot; said Barbara, wearily. &quot;It is all Greek to me: while
these gentlemen talk what I believe is called 'shop,' I am utterly unable to
follow the conversation.&quot;</p>
<p>Frank looked uneasily across at his wife, but said nothing.</p>
<p>&quot;What shall we talk about, Mrs. Churchill?&quot; said Mr. Dunster, with an evil
twinkle of his blue eyes. &quot;Shall it be the last ball in the Belgravia, or the
new <i>jupe</i>; how Mario sang in the <i>Prophète</i>, or whether bonnets will
be worn on or off the head?&quot;</p>
<p>Churchill frowned at this remark, but his brow cleared as Barbara said with
curling lip:</p>
<p>&quot;You need not go so far for illustrations of what you don't understand, Mr.
Dunster. Let us discuss tolerance, domestic enjoyments, or the pleasure of being
liked by any one,--all of which axe, I am sure, equally strange to you.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Dunster winced, and the fire faded out of his blue eyes: he did not
understand being bearded. Frank Churchill, though astonished at seeing his wife
defiant, was by no means displeased. Old Mr. Lacy, fearing a storm, which would
have ruffled him sadly, struck in at once:</p>
<p>&quot;It's a mistake, my dear Churchill; I'm convinced of it. We're not fit for
these charming creatures, we artists and writers, believe me. We're a deucedly
irritable, growling, horrible set of ruffians, who ought to be left, like a lot
of Robinson Crusoes, each on a separate island. I can fully enter into Mrs.
Churchill's feelings; and I've no doubt that Mrs. Lacy feels exactly the same.
But what do I do? I'm compelled to shut the door in Mrs. Lacy's face--to lock
Mrs. Lacy out. She's a most excellent woman, as you know, Churchill; but she
always wants to talk to me when I ought to be at work; now, on a sky-day, for
instance! There are very few days in the year in this detestable climate, my
dear Mrs. Churchill, which permit of one's seeing the sky sufficiently to paint
it. When such a day does happen, I go to my studio and lock the door; but I've
scarcely set my palette, before they come and rap, and want to talk to me--to
ask me about the butcher, or to tell me about the nurse's sister, or something;
and I'm obliged to whistle or sing to prevent my hearing 'em, or I should get
interested about the nurse's sister, and open the door, and then my day's work
would be spoilt.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're right, Lacy,&quot; said Dunster: &quot;men who've got work to do should remain
single. They'll never--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Come, you're polite to my wife,&quot; said Frank. &quot;This is flat blasphemy against
the state into which we've just entered.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, pray don't let the conversation, evidently so genial, be stopped on my
account. I'm tired, and am just going;&quot; and with a sweeping bow Barbara sailed
out of the room.</p>
<p>An hour afterwards, when Frank looked in from his dressing-room, he saw in
the dim light Barbara's hair streaming over the pillow, and going to her found
traces of tears on her cheeks. Tenderly and eagerly he asked her what had
happened.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Frank, Frank!&quot; she exclaimed, bursting into fresh sobs; &quot;I see it all
now! What those horrid men said is too true! We were worse than mad to marry.
Your friends will never understand me, while I shall interfere with your work
and your pleasure; and, oh! I am so very, very miserable myself!&quot;</p>

<h5>THE FLYBYNIGHTS.</h5>
<br>
<p>To such of womankind as knew of its existence there were few places in London
so thoroughly unpopular as the Flybynights Club. And yet it was an unpretending
little room, boasting none of the luxury of decoration generally associated in
the female mind with notions of club-life, and offering no inducement for
membership save that it was open at very abnormal hours, and that it was very
select. The necessary qualification for candidature was that you should be
somebody; no matter what your profession (provided, of course, that you were a
gentleman by position), you must have made some mark in it, shown yourself ahead
of the ruck of competitors, before you could have been welcome among the
Flybynights. Two or three leading advocates, attached for the most part to the
criminal bar; half-a-dozen landscape and figure painters of renown; half-a-dozen
actors; a sporting man or two, with the power of talking about something else
besides Brother to Bluenose's performances; two or three City men, who combined
the most thorough business habits with convivial tastes in the &quot;off&quot; hours; a
few members of Parliament, who were compelled to respect the room as a
thoroughly neutral ground; a few journalists and authors, and a sprinkling of
nothing-doing men about town,--formed the corporate body of the club. What was
its origin? I believe that certain members of the Haresfoot Club, finding that
establishment scarcely so convivial as report had led them to believe; that the
<i>Dii majores</i> of the house were a few snuffy old gentlemen, without an idea
beyond the assertion of their own dignity and the keeping up of some dreary
fictions and time-worn conventionalities; that the delights of the smoking-room,
so much talked of in the outer world, in reality consisted in sitting between a
talkative barrister and a silent stockbroker, or listening to the complaints
against the management of the club by the committee; finding, in fact, that the
place was dull, bethought them of establishing another where they could be more
amused. Hence the Flybynights.</p>
<p>The Flybynights had no house of their own; they merely occupied a room on the
basement of the Orpheus tavern,--a dull sombre old room, with big couches and
lounges covered with frayed leather, with a smoky old green-flock paper, and
with no ornament save a battered old looking-glass in a fly-blown frame.
Occasionally roisterers new to town, on their way to the big concert-room of the
Orpheus, where they were to be enchanted with the humour of Mr. Bloss's &quot;Dying
Cadger's Lament,&quot; or the pathos of Mr. Seeinault's &quot;Trim-built Wherry,&quot; would in
mistake push open the green-baize door leading to the Flybynights sanctum, and
immediately withdraw in dismay at the dinginess of the room and the grim aspect
of its occupants. That grimness, however, was only assumed at the apparition of
a stranger; when the members were alone among themselves, perfect freedom from
restraint was the rule. And if, on the next morning, the jurymen who listened
with awe to the withering denunciations which fell from the lips of the learned
counsel for the prosecution,--the bank-directors who nodded approval to the
suggestions of certain shrewd financiers,--the noble sitters who marked the
brows of the artists engaged on their portraits, &quot;sicklied o'er with the pale
cast of thought,&quot;--nay, even the patients who gazed with eager eyes to glean
something from the countenances of the physicians then clutching their
pulses,--had seen counsel, financiers, artists, and physicians on the previous
evening at the Flybynights, they could not have recognised them for the same
men. The fame of the club spread; anecdotes and <i>bon-mots</i> ran round town
more quickly, and were better received, when they had the Flybynight stamp. It
was rumoured that O'Blank and Macaster, the great authors, were occasionally to
be seen there in the flesh, conversing like ordinary mortals; heavy swells found
out that it was open as late as Pratt's, and asked each other, in elliptic
phraseology, &quot;Whether 'twasn't good kind place, eh? met 'musing kind fellahs
there; made laugh'n, that kind thing?&quot; But though they made various attempts at
election, they never got beyond an occasional visit to the club; friendly
attempts to smuggle them in as members were dead failures; and at every ballot,
generally held at midnight, the strident voice of Rupert Robinson, author and
dramatist, could be heard asking, at the mention of any candidate's name, &quot;Who
is he? what can he do? what has he done?&quot; questions which, unless satisfactorily
answered, caused the immediate pilling of the pretender to association with the
Flybynights.</p>
<p>A few weeks after the Schröders' reception, Beresford and Simnel, who had
been dining together, strolled into the club soon after midnight. Beresford was
a member; Simnel came as his guest; the latter would have been safe of election,
as his tact and shrewdness were very generally known and highly esteemed amongst
the men, but he always refused to be put in nomination. &quot;It's all very well for
Beresford,&quot; he would say; &quot;he's a Commissioner, and can do as he likes; I'm an
upper servant; and though you're a deuced pleasant set of fellows, you haven't
got a great name for respectability with the B.P., or British Public, whom I
serve. It's horribly virtuous, is the B.P., and is always in bed before you
sweet youths meet in this bower of bliss. So that though I'm delighted to come
occasionally with Charley and pay you a visit, I must be in a position, if
called upon, to swear that I'm not an affiliated member of your sacred
brotherhood.&quot; The other men understood all this, and liked Simnel better for his
candour; and there was no visitor at the Flybynights more welcome than he. It
was a great occasion at the Flybynights; one of the members, Mr. Plinlimmon the
poet, had that day been giving a lecture &quot;On Sentiment, its Use and Abuse,&quot; at
St. Cecilia's Hall, and had had great success. For Mr. Plinlimmon was not a mere
common poet who made verses and sold them; he was cousin to Lady Heritage, whose
husband was the Lord Privy-Purse; and he was very well off, and wrote only for
his amusement, and consequently was the very man to be patronised. Moreover, he
wrote weak little verselets, like very-much-diluted Wordsworth, abounding in
passages quotable for Academy pictures of bread-and-butter children; and he was
much taken up by Mr. Spicklittle, the editor of the <i>Boomerang Magazine</i>,
so soon as it was understood that he stood well with the fashionable world. And
there had been a very fashionable audience at St. Cecilia's Hall to hear Mr.
Plinlimmon on &quot;Sentiment,&quot; and the stalls had been filled with what was
afterwards stated in the public prints to be the rank and flower of the land;
and high-born women had complimented him on the conclusion of his labours, and
had voted his lecture charming; all of which thoroughly consoled the lecturer,
and enabled him to forget the rude conduct of certain rough-spoken critics in
the body of the hall, who had loudly cried &quot;Bosh!&quot; at his finest passages, and
gone out with much shuffling of thick boots and dropping of heavy walking-sticks
long before his peroration. And after dining with a countess, Mr. Plinlimmon
thought that the right thing was to go down and show himself at the Flybynights
Club, of which he was a member; and he had entered the room just before
Beresford and Simnel arrived.</p>
<p>&quot;Hail, Plinlimmon!&quot; shouted Mr. Magnus the historian, with kindly glances
beaming through his spectacles; &quot;hail, bard of the what-d'ye-call-it! How air
you, colonel?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hallo, Plinlimmon!&quot; shouted Mr. Rupert Robinson; &quot;been giving a show,
haven't you? what sort of house did you have? who looked after your checks? you
were very well billed, I noticed.&quot;</p>
<p>Plinlimmon shuddered.</p>
<p>&quot;Lecturing, haven't you?&quot; asked Mr. Slater, critic of the <i>Moon</i>.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Plinlimmon, &quot;I have been giving a lecture.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; said Mr. Schrink, critic of the <i>Statesman</i>, &quot;if I'm not wrong,
Dr. Johnson defines the verb to lecture as to 'instruct insolently and
dogmatically.' You're quite capable of that, Plinlimmon.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What was your subject, sir?&quot; asked Mr. Mugg, low comedian of the Sanspareil
Theatre.</p>
<p>&quot;Sentiment, sir!&quot; said Mr. Plinlimmon, fiercely; it began to dawn on him that
he was being chaffed.</p>
<p>&quot;Deary me!&quot; said Mr. Mugg, with feigned wonder and uplifted hands;
&quot;sentiment, eh? them's my sentiments!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Silence, you ribalds!&quot; said Mr. Magnus. &quot;You had a large attendance, I hear,
Plinlimmon; more women than men, though, I suppose? Men don't come in the
daytime.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There was a great gathering of the female aristocracy,&quot; said Plinlimmon,
perking up his head.</p>
<p>&quot;One old woman jawing always brings together a lot of others,&quot; growled Mr.
Dunster, beneath his breath. He had been apparently dozing in a far corner of
the room, but had roused up at the word &quot;aristocracy,&quot;--as sure an irritant to
him as a red rag to a bull,--and his bright blue eyes were gleaming.</p>
<p>&quot;I didn't think much of your delivery, Plinlimmon,&quot; said Mr. Slater.</p>
<p>&quot;It was as slow as a midday postman's, and not so sure,&quot; said Mr. Schrink;
&quot;you got uncommonly drowsy and bag-pipy at times.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll tell you what it is Plinlimmon,&quot; said Mr. Dunster; &quot;you are uncommonly
dreary! You're a swell, and you can't help it; but you were horribly slow. I'll
tell you what it is, my young friend; you're far too dull by yourself,--<i>you
want a piano</i>.&quot;</p>
<p>During the roar which followed this remark, Beresford felt a light touch on
his arm, and turning round saw Dr. Prater.</p>
<p>Not to be known to Dr. Prater was to confess that the &quot;pleasure of your
acquaintance&quot; was of little value; for assuredly, had it been worth any thing,
Dr. Prater would have had it by hook or by crook. A wonderful man, Dr. Prater,
who had risen from nothing, as his detractors said; but however that might be,
he had a practice scarcely excelled by any in London. Heart and lungs were Dr.
Prater's specialities; and persons imagining themselves afflicted in those
regions came from all parts of England, and thronged the doctor's dining room in
Queen-Anne Street in the early forenoons, vainly pretending to read Darwin <i>On
the Fertilisation of Orchids, the Life of Captain Hedley Vicars</i>, or the
Supplement of yesterday's <i>Times</i>; and furtively glancing round at the
other occupants of the room, and wondering what was the matter with them. That
dining-room looked rather different about a dozen times in the season, of an
evening, when the books were cleared away, and the big bronze gas-chandelier
lighted, and the doctor sat at the large round-table surrounded by a dozen of
the pleasantest people in London. Such a mixture! Never was such a man for
&quot;bringing people together&quot; as Dr. Prater. The manager of the Italian Opera (Dr.
Prater's name was to all the sick-certificates for singers) would be seated next
to a judge, who would have a leading member of the Jockey Club on his other
hand, and a bishop for his <i>vis-à-vis</i>. Next the bishop would be a
cotton-lord, next to him the artist of a comic periodical, and next to him a
rising member of the Opposition, with an Indian colonel and an American
comedian, here on a starring engagement, in juxtaposition. The dinner was always
good, the wines excellent, and the doctor was the life and soul of the party. He
had something special to say to every one; and as his big protruding eyes shone
and glimmered through his gold-rimmed spectacles, he looked like a convivial
little owl. A very different man over the dinner-table to the smug little
pale-faced man in black, whom wretched patients found in the morning sitting
behind a leather-covered table, on which a stethoscope was conspicuously
displayed, and who, after sounding the chests of consumptive curates or
struggling clerks, would say, with an air of blandness, dashed with sorrow, &quot;I'm
afraid the proverbially treacherous air of our climate will not do for us, my
dear sir! I'm afraid we must spend our winter at Madeira, or at least at Pau. <i>
Good</i> day to you;&quot; and then the doctor, after shaking hands with his patient,
would slip the tips of his fingers into his trousers-pockets, into which would
fall another little paper-package to join a number already there deposited,
while the curate or clerk, whose yearly income was perhaps two hundred pounds,
and who probably had debts amounting to twice his annual earnings, would go away
wondering whether it was better to endeavour to borrow the further sum necessary
at ruinous interest, or to go back and die in the cold Lincolnshire clay parish,
or in the bleak Northern city, as the case might be. On one thing the doctor
prided himself greatly, that he never let a patient know what he thought of him.
He would bid a man remove his waistcoat with a semi-jocund air, and the next
instant listen to a peculiar &quot;click&quot; inside his frame, which betrayed the
presence of heart-disease liable at any moment to carry the man off, without
altering a muscle of his face or a tone of his voice. &quot;Hum! ha! we must be a
little careful; we must not expose ourselves to the night-air! Take a leetle
more care of yourself, my dear sir; for instance, I would wear a wrap round the
throat--some wrap, you know, to prevent the cold striking to the part affected.
Send this to Bell's, and get it made up, and take it three times a-day; and let
me see you on--on Saturday. <i>Good</i> day to you.&quot; And there would not be the
smallest quiver in the hard metallic voice, or the smallest twinkle in the
observant eye behind the gold-rimmed glasses, although the doctor knew that the
demon Consumption, by his buffet, had raised that red spot on the sufferer's
cheek, and was rapidly eating away his vitality.</p>
<p>But if Dr. Prater kept a strict reticence to his patients as regarded their
own ailments, he was never so happy as when enlarging to them on the diseases of
their fellow-sufferers, or of informing esoteric circles of the special
varieties of disorder with which his practice led him to cope. &quot;<i>You</i> ill,
my dear sir!&quot; he would say to some puny specimen; then, settling himself into
his waistcoat after examination, &quot;<i>you</i> complain of
narrow-chestedness,--why, my dear sir, do you know Sir Hawker de la Crache?
You've a pectoral development which is perfectly surprising when contrasted with
Sir Hawker's. But then he, poor man! last stage,--Madeira no good,--would sit up
all night playing whist at Reid's Hotel. Algiers no good,--too much brandy,
tobacco, and <i>baccarat</i> with French officers--nothing any good. <i>You</i>,
my dear sir, compared to Sir Hawker--pooh, nonsense!&quot; Or in another form: &quot;Any
such case, my dear madam? any such case?&quot;--turning to a large book, having
previously consulted a small index--&quot;a hundred such! Here, for instance, Lady
Susan Bray, now staying at Ventnor, living entirely on asses'-milk--in some of
our conditions we must live on asses'-milk--left lung quite gone, life hanging
by a thread. You're a Juno, ma'am, in comparison to Lady Susan!&quot; There was no
mistake, however, about the doctor's talent; men in his own profession, who
sneered at his <i>charlatanerie</i> of manner, allowed that he was thoroughly
well versed in his subject. He was very fond of young men's society; and, with
all his engagements, always found time to dine occasionally with the Guards at
Windsor, with a City Company or two, or with a snug set <i>en petit comité</i>
in Temple chambers, and to visit the behind-scenes of two or three theatres, the
receptions of certain great ladies, and occasionally the meetings of the
Flybynights Club. To the latter he always came in a special suit of clothes on
account of the impregnation of tobacco-smoke; and when coming thither he left
his carriage and his address, in case he was required, at the Minerva, with
orders to fetch him at once. It would never have done for some of his patients
to know that he was a member of the Flybynights.</p>
<p>Such was Dr. Prater, who touched Beresford on the arm and said, &quot;Not again,
my dear sir! I will not be balked of the opportunity of saying, 'how d'ye do?'
to you again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, doctor,&quot; said Beresford with that apparent frankness and <i>bonhomie</i>
to which he owed so much of his popularity, &quot;delighted to see you! But what do
you mean 'balked of the opportunity'? Where was that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A few weeks since, just before I left town;--I've been away, and Dr. Seaton
has kindly attended to my practice;--we met at the house of our charming friend
Mrs. Schröder; but I could not catch your eye. You were too well engaged; there
was, as somebody--I don't know who, but somebody that every one knows--has said,
there was metal more attractive. Ha! ha! A charming woman, Mrs. Schröder! a very
charming woman!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very charming,&quot; echoed Mr. Beresford shortly, not particularly caring about
finding himself thoroughly focussed by the doctor's sharpest glances
concentrated through his spectacles. &quot;By the way, don't you know our secretary,
Mr. Simnel, Dr. Prater?&quot;</p>
<p>The gentlemen bowed. &quot;I have the pleasure of being well acquainted with Mr.
Simnel by name, and of being at the present moment engaged in a correspondence
with him in reference to a certificate which I have given. And, by the way, my
dear sir,&quot; turning to Simnel, &quot;you really must give young Pierrepoint his six
weeks. You must indeed!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If it rested with me, doctor, I'd give him unlimited leave; confer on him
the order of the 'sack,'&quot; said Simnel, bluntly--&quot;an idle stuck-up young hound!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Harsh words, my dear sir; harsh words! However, I will leave our young
friend's case with you and Mr. Beresford; I am sure it could not be in better
hands. You were not in Saxe-Coburg Square the other night, I think? De-lightful
party!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Simnel, &quot;I'm not a great evening-party man myself; it's only your
butterflies of fashion, like our friend here, who enjoy those light and airy
gaieties. My pleasures are of a more substantial kind. By the way, doctor, how's
Kitty Vavasour's cough?&quot;</p>
<p>The doctor's eyes twinkled as he replied, &quot;Oh, much better--very much better.
Horrible draught down that first entrance, my dear sir, as she perhaps told--I
mean, as you probably know. Dreadful draught! enough to kill half the <i>
coryphées</i> in London. I've spoken to Grabb about it, but he won't do any
thing; and when I hinted at the drapery, asked me if I thought he was going to
let his ballet-girls dance in bathing-gowns. Very rude man, Grabb.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very good style they did that in the other night,&quot; said Beresford, cutting
in--&quot;in Saxe-Coburg Square, I mean--very good, wasn't it? I suppose it was the
lady's taste; but when they get hold of a woman with any notion of arrangement
and effect, these <i>parvenu</i> fellows from the City certainly don't grudge
the money for their fun. And in the way the Schröders are living, the
establishment must cost a pretty sum, I should imagine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A pretty sum indeed, my dear sir,&quot; said the doctor. &quot;However, I understand
on all sides that Mr. Schröder can perfectly afford it. I hear from those who
ought to know&quot; (a great phrase of Dr. Prater's, this) &quot;that his income is
princely!&quot; And then the doctor looked at the other two and repeated &quot;princely!&quot;
and smacked his lips as though the word had quite a nice taste in his mouth.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a good thing to be a Polish Jew,&quot; growled Mr. Simnel. &quot;This fellow's
ancestors lent money to long-haired Grafs and swaggering Electors, and got their
interest when they could; and thought themselves deuced lucky not to get their
teeth pulled out when they asked for a little on account, or not to be put on
the fire when they presented their bill. Their descendant lives in pleasanter
days; we've given up pulling out their teeth, worse luck! And that neat little
instrument, 'Victoria, by the grace,' is as open to Jews as Christians. I always
thought there was something wrong in that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This Schröder is a tremendously lucky fellow, by Jove!&quot; said Beresford.
&quot;He's got a very pretty wife and an enormous fortune; and though he's not young,
to judge from all appearances, has a constitution of iron, and will live for
years to enjoy his good fortune.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, my dear sir,&quot; said Dr. Prater in a low and solemn voice, &quot;I'm afraid
you're not correct in one particular; not correct in one particular!&quot; and the
little man shook his head and looked specially oracular.</p>
<p>Simnel glanced up at him at once from under his heavy eyebrows; but Beresford
only said, &quot;Why, doctor, you're not going to try and make me believe any envious
disparagement of Schröder's riches?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not for the world, my dear sir; not for the world! Such rumours have been
spread! but, as you say, only among the envious and jealous, who would
whisper-away Coutts's credit, and decline to intrust their miserable balance to
Barings'! No; my doubts as to Schröder relate to another matter.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;His health?&quot; said Simnel, who had kept his eyes on the solemn little man,
and was regarding him keenly.</p>
<p>&quot;Pre-cisely!&quot; said the doctor. And he stepped aside for an instant, helped
himself to a pinch of snuff from a box on a neighbouring table, and returned to
his companions, gazing up at them with a solemn steady stare that made him look
more like an owl than ever.</p>
<p>&quot;His health!&quot; exclaimed Beresford, &quot;why there's surely nothing the matter
with that! He has the chest of a horse and the digestion of an ostrich. I don't
know a man of his age to whom, to look at, you'd give a longer life.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right, my dear sir,&quot; replied the doctor, &quot;right enough from a
non-professional view. But Mr. Schröder, like the gentleman of whom I have
heard, but whose name I can't call to mind, has that within which passeth show.
I <i>know</i> the exact state of his condition.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is very interesting,&quot; said Mr. Simnel, drawing closer to the doctor on
the ottoman; &quot;very interesting, indeed; yours is a wonderful profession, doctor,
for gaining insight into men and things. Would it be too much to ask you to tell
us a little more about this particular case?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, you know, I don't often talk of these matters; there are men in our
profession, my dear sir, who gossip and chatter, and I believe make it pay very
well; but they are men of no intellect, mere quacks and charlatans--quacks and
charlatans! But with gentlemen like yourselves, men of the world, I don't mind
occasionally revealing a few of the secrets of the--the--what d'ye call
'em?--prison-house. The fact is--&quot; and the doctor lowered his voice and looked
additionally solemn,--&quot;that Mr. Schröder's life hangs by a thread.&quot;</p>
<p>Both his listeners started, and Mr. Simnel from between his set teeth said,
&quot;The devil!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;By a thread!&quot; repeated the doctor, holding out his finger and thumb as
though he actually had the thread between them. &quot;He may go off at any moment;
his life is not certain for an hour; he's engaged, as you know, in tremendous
transactions, and any sudden fright or passion would be his certain death.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, then his disease is--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Heart, my dear sir, heart!&quot; said the doctor, tapping himself on the left
side of his waistcoat; &quot;his heart's diseased,--one cannot exactly say how far,
but I suspect strongly,--and he may go out at any moment like the snuff of a
candle.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Have you known this long?&quot; asked Beresford.</p>
<p>&quot;Only two days: he came to me two days ago to consult me about a little
worrying cough which he described himself as having; and in listening at his
chest I heard the death-beat. No mistaking it, my dear sir; when you've once
heard that 'click,' you never forget it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;By Jove, how horrible!&quot; said Simnel.</p>
<p>&quot;Poor devil! does he know it himself?&quot; asked Beresford.</p>
<p>&quot;Know it, my dear sir? Of course not. You don't imagine <i>I</i> told him?
Why the shock might have killed him on the spot. Oh, dear, no! I prescribed for
his cough, and told him specially to avoid all kind of excitement: that was the
only warning I dare give him.&quot;</p>
<p>As the doctor said this, Mr. Simnel rose. &quot;It's a horrible idea,&quot; said he
with a shudder--&quot;horrible!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very common, my dear sir, very common. If you knew how many men there are
whom I meet out at dinner, in society, here and there, whom I know to be as
distinctly marked for death as if I saw the plague-spot on their breasts!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, you've completely frightened me,&quot; said Beresford. &quot;I'll get home to
bed, and try and forget it in sleep. Are you coming, Simnel? Good night,
doctor.&quot; And the two gentlemen went out together, leaving the little doctor
already sidling up to another group.</p>
<p>When they were out in the street, and had started on their homeward walk,
Simnel said to his companion:</p>
<p>&quot;That was strange news we've just heard.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Strange, indeed,&quot; replied Beresford. &quot;Do you think the doctor's right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not a doubt of it; he's a garrulous idiot; as full of talk as an old woman;
but I have always heard very skilful in his profession, and in this special
disease I believe there are none to beat him. Oh, yes, he's right enough. Well,
you always held winning cards, and now the game looks like yours.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Simnel,&quot; said Beresford, stopping short and looking up into his face, &quot;what
the devil do you mean?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mean!&quot; echoed Simnel; &quot;I'll tell you when you come on; it's cold stopping
still in the streets, and the policeman at the corner is staring at you in
unmitigated wonder. Mean!&quot; he repeated, as they walked on; &quot;well, it's not a
very difficult matter to explain. You hear that Schröder has heart-disease--that
at any moment he may die. You always had a partiality for Mrs. Schröder, I
believe; and if there be any truth in what I gather from yourself and others,
you stand very well with her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well! You're dense to-night, Master Charley. Well? Why, you've as great a
chance as man ever had before you. You've only to wait until what Prater told us
of happens,--and if he's right, it won't be long,--and then marry the widow and
start as a millionaire.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;By Jove, it <i>is</i> a great chance!&quot; said Beresford, looking at his
friend.</p>
<p>&quot;And yet you didn't see it until just now. Why, it opened straight up in
front of me the instant that chattering medico mentioned the fact. If you play
your cards well, you're all right; but remember, flirtation and courtship are
two different things, and must be managed differently. And recollect it's for
the latter you're now going in. Now, here's my street, so adieu. Sleep on this
matter, and we'll talk of it to-morrow morning.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p>&quot;It's a tremendous fluke,&quot; said Mr. Simnel, as he leisurely undressed
himself; &quot;but it will serve my purpose admirably. That eight hundred pounds of
mine lent to Master Charley looks much less shaky than it did, and what a
trump-card to play with Kate!&quot;</p>
<br>

<h4><a name="div1_22" href="#div1Ref_22">CHAPTER XXII.</a></h4>
<h5>MR. SIMNEL AT THE DEN.</h5>
<br>
<p>Two days after the events recorded in the last chapter, Mr. Simnel left the
Tin-Tax Office a couple of hours earlier than his usual time of departure, and
taking a cab, hurried off to his apartments in Piccadilly. Overlooking the Green
Park, sufficiently lofty to be removed from the immediate noise of the traffic,
and situate in that part of the street which was macadamised, there were,
perhaps, no more delightful chambers in town than those occupied by the Tin-Tax
secretary. They consisted but of three rooms--sitting-room, bed-chamber, and
bath-room; but all were lofty and well-proportioned, and were furnished in a
thoroughly luxurious manner. A big bookcase, with its contents admirably
selected, covered one side of the sitting-room, on the walls of which hung
Raphael Morghen prints, and before-letter proofs after Landseer, Leslie, and
Stanfield; a round table, over which were suspended three swinging
moderator-lamps, with white-china shades and crimson-silk fringe; a sofa and
numerous easy-chairs, all in crimson velvet and walnut-wood; rich spoils of
Bohemian glass, standing in odd corners on quaint oak cabinets; two Sèvres china
dogs, in begging attitude, mounting guard on either end of the mantelshelf; and
a flying female figure suspended across the looking-glass;--such were among the
incongruous contents of the room. On the table, two yellow-paper covered French
novels, a Horace, and M'Culloch's Commercial Directory lay side by side; in the
looking-glass, cards for evening-parties and dinners were jostled by tickets
soliciting vote and interest in approaching elections of charitable societies,
remindings of gatherings of learned bodies, and small bills for books or boots.
It was Mr. Simnel's pleasure to keep up this <i>mélange</i>; his time was
generally fully occupied; he chose people to consider that he had not a moment
to himself; he wished those who called on him on business to see the
invitations, in order that they might judge therefrom of his position in
society; and he took care that the attention of those idle droppers-in, who came
on a Sunday morning, for instance, or late at night, to have a chat, should be
directed to the business-cards, to give them a notion of his standing in the
money-making, business world. Since Mr. Simnel assumed the reins at the Tin-Tax
Office, two or three hundred men had sat with their legs under that round table,
discussing an excellent dinner, and meeting pleasant people; but not one of them
had ever left the room without Mr. Simnel's feeling that his coming had been
productive of benefit to his host, and that the invitation had fully answered
its intent. Baron Oppenhardt, the great financier, never could tell what made
him accept Simnel's invitation, save that he knew his host was connected with
Government and had a long head of his own; yet he never refused. And little
Blurt, whose &quot;connexion with the press&quot; was of a limited nature, never could
understand why, biennially, he sat under those shaded moderator-lamps in
Piccadilly, and consumed Pommery Greno out of bell-shaped glasses. But Simnel
knew why he had them to dinner, and took their value out of both Oppenhardt and
Blurt.</p>
<p>A long-headed man, Mr. Simnel, and, to judge from the strange smile on his
face on that particular day, full of some special scheme, as he emerged from his
bedroom and looked out into Piccadilly. Any thing but a vain man, and long past
the age when the decoration of one's person enters largely into account, Mr.
Simnel had yet paid special attention to his toilette during the short interval
which had elapsed since his arrival at home from the Tin-Tax Office. He was got
up with elaborate care and yet perfect simplicity; indeed, there was a touch of
the old school in his drab riding-trousers, white waistcoat, blue cut-away coat,
and blue bird's-eye neckerchief, with small stand-up collars. A glance into the
street showed him that his horses were ready, and he descended at once. At the
door he found his groom mounted on a knowing-looking gray cob, short, stiff, and
sturdy, and leading a splendid thoroughbred bright bay with black points. This
Mr. Simnel mounted and rode easily away.</p>
<p>Through Decimus Burton's archway he turned into Hyde Park and made at once
for the Row. There were but few men lounging about there at that time of the
year, but Simnel was known to some of them; and after nods had been exchanged,
they fell to comparing notes about him and his horse and his style of living,
wondering how it was done, admiring his cleverness, detracting from his
position--talking, in fact, as men will do of another who has beat them in this
grand struggle for place which we call life. The Row was very empty, and Simnel
paid but little attention to its occupants: now and then he occasionally raised
his whip mechanically in acknowledgment of some passing salute, but it is to be
doubted whether he knew to whom he was telegraphing, as his thoughts were
entirely fixed on his mission. However, he wore a pleasant smile on his face,
and that was quite enough: grinning, like charity, covers a multitude of sins;
and if you only smile and hold your tongue, you can pass through life with an <i>
éclat</i> which excellent eloquence, combined with a serious face, would fail to
give. So Mr. Simnel went smiling along at the easiest amble until he got clear
of the Row and the town, and then he gave the bay his head, and never drew rein
until he turned up a country lane immediately on passing Ealing Common.</p>
<p>Half way up this lane stood The Den, and evidences of Kate Mellon's calling
began to abound so soon as you turned out of the high-road. In the fields on
either side through the bare hedges one could see a string of horses in cloths
and head-pieces, each ridden by a groom, skirting the hedges along which a
proper riding-path had been made; occasionally a yellow break, driven by a
veteran coachman, with a younger and more active coadjutor perched up behind,
and standing with his eyes on a level with the coach-box observing every motion
of the horses, would rumble by, while the clay-coloured gig containing Mr.
Sandcrack the veterinary surgeon, who, in his long white cravat, beard, and
tight trousers, looked a pleasant compound of a dissenting-minister, a
horse-jockey, and an analytical chemist, was flying in and out of the lane at
all times and seasons. Mr. Simnel seemed accustomed to these scenes and
thoroughly well known amongst them, the grooms and breaksmen touched their hats
to him, and he exchanged salutations with Mr. Sandcrack, and told him that the
bay had got rid of all his wind-galls and never went better in his life. So
straight up the lane until he arrived at the lodge, and then, before his groom
could ride up, his cheery cry of &quot;Gate!&quot; brought out the buxom lodge-keeper, and
she also greeted Mr. Simnel with a curtsey of recognition, and received his
largesse as he rode through; so down the little carriage-drive, past the
pigeon-house elevated on a pole, and the pointers' kennels, and the strip of
garden cultivated by the lodge-keeper, and in which one of the lodge-keeper's
dirty chubby children was always sprawling; past the inner gates, through which
could be caught glimpses of the circular straw-ride, and the stable and loose
boxes, and the neatly gravelled courtyard, up the sweep and so to the
house-door. Freeman, the staid stud-groom from Yorkshire, had seen the visitor's
entry from the stable, where he was superintending, and hurried up to meet him.
Before Mr. Simnel's own groom had come alongside, Freeman was at his horse's
head.</p>
<p>&quot;Mornin', sir,&quot; said he, touching his hat. &quot;Missis is oop at u, close
by, givin' lesson to a young leddy, just by t' water soide: joompin' brook, oi
think. Howsever she'll be in d'rackly, oi know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All right, Freeman,&quot; said Mr. Simnel, leisurely dismounting. &quot;Horses all
well? Fine weather for horseflesh, this!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ay, ay, it be, sir!&quot; said the old man. &quot;Stood be pratty well, oi'm thinkin':
coughs and colds, and that loike, as is allays case this toime o' year.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't hurry Miss Mellon on my account, Freeman,&quot; said Mr. Simnel; &quot;I can
wait. I'll go into the house, and you can let her know that I'm here, when she
comes in. By the way, Freeman, I haven't seen you since Christmas: here's for
old acquaintance' sake.&quot;</p>
<p>Freeman touched his hat gratefully, but not submissively, as he pocketed the
half-sovereign which Mr. Simnel slipped into his capacious palm, and moved off
towards the stables with the groom and the horses.</p>
<p>&quot;Good man, that,&quot; said Simnel to himself, as he went into the house.
&quot;Straightforward, conscientious sort of fellow, and thoroughly devoted to <i>her</i>.
Proper style of man to have in an establishment: thoroughly respectable--do one
credit by his looks. If it ever comes off, I certainly should keep Mr. Freeman
on.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Simnel passed on into the long low dining-room, where he found the table
spread for luncheon, with a very substantial display of cold roast beef, fowls,
and tongue, sherry, and a tall bottle of German wine. He smiled as he noticed
these preparations, and then leisurely walked round the room. He paused at an
oil-painting of Kate with a favourite horse by her side. The artist evidently
knew much more about the equine than the human race. The horse's portrait was
admirable, but poor Kitty, with vermilion cheeks and glaring red hair, and a
blue habit with long daubs of light in it, like rain-streaks on a window, was a
lamentable object to look on. Only one other picture decorated the walls, a
portrait of the Right Hon. the Earl of Quorn, aged 61, founder of the Society
for the Relief of Incapacitated Jobmasters and Horse-dealers, dedicated to him
by his faithful servants the publishers; representing a hale old gentleman,
remarkable principally for his extraordinary length of check-neckcloth, seated
on a weight-carrying cob, and staring intently at nothing. On a side-table lay a
thick book, <i>Youatt on the Horse</i>, and a thin pamphlet, <i>Navicular not
Incurable</i>, a <i>Little Warbler</i> (poor Kitty!), and a kind of album, into
which a heterogeneous mixture of recipes for horse-medicines, scraps of hunting
news, lists of prices fetched at the sales of celebrated studs, and other
sporting memoranda had been pasted. Simnel was looking through this, and had
just come upon a slip of printed matter, evidently cut from a newspaper,
announcing the appointment of Mr. Charles Beresford to be a commissioner of the
Tin-Tax Office, in place of Cockle pensioned--a slip against which there were
three huge deep pencil-scorings--when the door opened and his hostess entered.</p>
<p>Although her habit was draggled and splashed, and her hair disarranged and
blown about her face, Kate Mellon never had looked, to Simnel's eyes at least,
more thoroughly charming than she did at that instant. The exercise she had just
gone through had given her a splendid colour, her eyes were bright and
sparkling, her whole frame showed to perfection in the tight-fitting jacket; and
as she came into the room and removed her hat, the knot of hair behind, loosened
from the comb, fell over her shoulders in golden profusion. She wound it up at
once with one hand, advancing with the other outstretched to her guest.</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry I'm late, Simnel,&quot; said she; &quot;but I had a pupil here, and business is
business, as you know well enough. Can't afford to throw away any chance, so I
gave her her hour, and now she's off, and I am all the better by a guinea. I
didn't stop to change my habit because I heard you were waiting, and I knew you
wouldn't mind.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You couldn't look more enchanting than you do now, Kate,&quot; said Simnel.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, yes; I know,&quot; said Kitty; &quot;all right! But I thought you knew better
than that. This is the wrong shop for flummery of that sort, as you ought to
have learnt by this time. Have some lunch?&quot;</p>
<p>They sat down to the table, and during the meal talked on ordinary subjects;
for the most part discussing their common acquaintance, but always carefully
avoiding bringing Beresford's name forward. When they had finished, Kate said,
&quot;You want to smoke, of course. I think I shall have a puff myself. No, thank
you; your weeds are too big for me; I've got some Queens here that old Sir John
Elle sent me after I broke that roan mare for his daughter. By George, what a
brute that was! nearly killed me at first, she did; and now you might ride her
with a pack-thread.&quot;</p>
<p>Simnel did not reply. Kate Mellon curled herself up on an ottoman in the
window with her habit tucked round her; lit a small cigar; and slowly expelling
the smoke said, as the blue vapour curled round her head, &quot;And now to business!
You wanted to talk to me, you said; and I told you to come up to-day. What's it
all about?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;About yourself, Kate. You know thoroughly well my feelings to you; you know
how often I have--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hold on a minute!&quot; said Kate; &quot;I know that you've been philandering and
hanging on about me,--or would have been, if I'd have let you,--for this year
past. I know that well enough; but I thought there was to be none of this. I
thought I'd told you to drop that subject, and that you'd consented to drop it.
I told you I wouldn't listen to you, and--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why would not you listen to me, Kate?&quot; said Simnel earnestly.</p>
<p>&quot;Why? Because--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't trouble yourself to find an excuse; I'll tell you why,&quot; said Simnel.
&quot;Because you were desperately bent on a fruitless errand; because you were
beating the wind and trying to check the storm; because you were in love,--I
must speak plainly, Kitty, in a matter like this,--in love with a man who did
not return your feeling, and who even now is boasting of your passion, and
laughing at you as its dupe!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What!&quot; cried the girl, throwing away the cigar and starting to her feet.</p>
<p>&quot;Sit down, child,&quot; said Simnel, gently laying his hand on her arm; &quot;sit down,
and hear me out. I know your pluck and spirit; and nothing grieves me more, or
goes more against the grain with me, than to have to tell you this. But when I
tell you that the man to whom you so attached yourself has spoken lightly and
sneeringly of your infatuation; that amongst his friends he has laughingly
talked of a scene which occurred on the last occasion of his visit to this
house, when you suggested that he should marry you--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did he say that?&quot; asked the girl, pushing her hair back from her face,--&quot;did
he say that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That and more; laughed at the notion, and--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;O my God!&quot; shrieked Kate Mellon, throwing up her arms. &quot;Spare me! stop, for
Heaven's sake, and don't let me hear any more. Did he say that of me? Then
they'll all know it, and when I meet them will grin and whisper as I know they
do. Haven't I heard them do it of others a thousand times? and now to think
they'll have the pull of me. O good Lord, good Lord!&quot; and she burst into tears
and buried her face in her handkerchief. Then suddenly rousing, she exclaimed:
&quot;What do you come and tell me this for, Simnel? What business is it of yours?
What's your motive in coming and smashing me up like this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;One, and one only,&quot; said Simnel in a low voice. &quot;I wanted to prevent your
demeaning yourself by ever showing favour to a man who has treated you so
basely. I wanted you to show your own pride and spirit by blotting this
Beresford from your thoughts. I wanted you to do this--whatever may be the
result--because--I love you, Kate!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's it!&quot; she cried suddenly--&quot;that's it! You're telling me lies and long
stories, and breaking my heart, and making me make a fool of myself, only that
you may stand well with me and get me to like you! How do I know what you say is
true? Why should Charley do this? Why did Charley refuse what I offered him? I
meant it honestly enough, God knows. Oh, why did he refuse it?&quot; and again she
burst into tears.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, he did refuse it?&quot; said Simnel, quietly. &quot;So far, then you see I am
right; and you will find I am right throughout. I'll tell you why he acted as he
did to you. Because he's full of family pride, and because he never cared for
you one rush. At this very moment he is desperately in love with a married
woman, and is only awaiting her husband's death to make her his wife!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Can you prove that?&quot; asked Kate eagerly.</p>
<p>&quot;I can! you shall have ample opportunity of satisfying yourself--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Does the husband suspect?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not in the least.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's right!&quot; said the girl with sudden energy--&quot;that'll do! Only let me
prove that, and I'll give him up for ever.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If I do this for you, Kitty, surely my love will be sufficiently proved. You
will then--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, we'll talk of that afterwards. I'll see you next week, and you'll tell
me more of this new love-affair of--of <i>his!</i> Don't stop now. I'm all out
of sorts. You've upset me. I wasn't in condition. I've been doing a little too
much work lately. Go now, there's a good fellow! Good-by.&quot; Then stopping
suddenly--&quot;You're sure you're not selling me, Simnel?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I swear it!&quot; said Simnel.</p>
<p>&quot;I wish to heaven you had been,&quot; said the poor girl; &quot;but we'll see about the
new business next week. I think we'll spoil that pretty game between us, eh?
There, good-by.&quot; And she set her teeth tight, and rushed from the room.</p>
<p>&quot;So fax so good,&quot; said Mr. Simnel, as he rode quietly home. &quot;She's taken it
almost a little too strongly. My plan now is to soften her and turn her to me. I
think I have a card in my hand that will win that trick, and then--the game's my
own!&quot;</p>

<h4><a name="div1_23" href="#div1Ref_23">CHAPTER XXIII.</a></h4>
<h5>MR. BERESFORD IN PURSUIT.</h5>
<br>
<p>The idea suggested by Simnel, after the interview with Dr. Prater at the
Flybynights, came upon Mr. Beresford with extraordinary force. It opened up to
him a new train of thought, gave a complete turn to his intended course of life,
afforded him matter for the deepest study and reflection. As we have already
seen, he was a man with a faultless digestion, and without a scrap of heart--two
qualities which had undoubtedly greatly conduced towards his success in life,
and towards making him a careless, easy-going worldly philosopher. When he first
saw Miss Townshend at Bissett Grange, he remembered her as a cheery little flirt
whom he had met during the previous season; and finding her companionable and
amusing, determined to carry on a flirtation which should serve as a pastime,
and, at the break-up of the party, be consigned to that limbo already replete
with similar <i>amourettes</i>. The presence of Captain Lyster, and the
unmistakable evidence of his passion for the young lady, gave Mr. Beresford very
little annoyance; he had a notion that, save in very exceptional cases, of which
indeed he had had no experience, women had a horror of an earnest lover; that
watchings and waitings, hangings on words, deep gazings into eyes, and all
outward signs of that passion which induces melancholy and affords themes for
poets, were as much <i>rococo</i> and out of date as carrying a lady's glove in
your hat and perpetually seeking a fight with some one on her account. He
thought that women hated &quot;dreary&quot; lovers, and were far more likely to be won by
rattle, laughter, and raillery than by the deepest devotion of a silent and
sighing order. Moreover, as he was only going in for flirtation, he would make
his running while it lasted, and leave the Captain to come in with the
weight-carrying proprieties after he had gone.</p>
<p>So far at first. Then came the recollection of his straitened position, the
reflection that Miss Townshend was an heiress, and the determination to go in
seriously for a proposal--a determination which was very short-lived, owing to
the discovery of the lady's engagement to Gustav Schröder. From the time of her
marriage, Mrs. Schröder was by Beresford mentally relegated to a corps which
included several married ladies of his acquaintance; for the most part young and
pretty women, whose husbands were either elderly, or immersed in business, or,
what was equally available, immersed in pleasure, and more attentive to other
men's wives than to their own; ladies who required &quot;notice,&quot; as they phrased it,
and who were sufficiently good-looking to command it from some men, between whom
and themselves there existed a certain understanding. Nothing criminal, nor
approaching to criminality; for despite the revelations of the Divorce Court,
there is, I take it, a something, whether it be in what is called our phlegmatic
temperament, whether it be in the bringing-up of our English girls,--bringing-up
of domesticity utterly unknown to Continental-bred young ladies, which hallows
and keeps constantly present the image of the doting father and the tender
mother, and all the sacred home-associations,--a something which strengthens the
weak and arrests the hand of the spoiler, and leaves the sacrifice incomplete.
The necessity for &quot;notice,&quot; or for &quot;being understood,&quot; or &quot;for having some one
to rely on&quot; (the husband engaged in business or in the House being, of course,
utterly untrustworthy), has created a kind of society which I can only describe
as a kind of solid bread-and-butter <i>demi-monde</i>--a <i>demi-monde</i>
which, as compared with that state of existence known in France under the title,
is as a club to a tavern, where the same things are carried on, but in a far
more genteel and decorous manner. The relations of its different members to each
other are as free from Wertherian sentimentalism as they are from Parisian
license, and would probably be considered severely correct by that circle of
upper Bohemians, of whose lives the younger Dumas has constituted himself the
chronicler.</p>
<p>Having, then, mentally appointed Mrs. Schröder a member of this society, Mr.
Beresford took upon himself the office of her cavalier, and behaved to her in
due form. When they were in company together, he sedulously kept his eyes upon
her, strove to anticipate her wishes, and let her see that it was she who
entirely absorbed him; he always dropped his voice when he spoke to her, even
though it were about the merest trifle; and he invariably took notice of the
arrangements of her dress, hair, and appearance in general, and made suggestions
which, being in excellent taste, were generally approved and carried out. Then
he found out Mrs. Schröder's romantic side, a little bit of nineteenth-century
sentiment, dashed with drawing-room cynicism, which found its exponent in Mr.
Owen Meredith's weaker verses; and there they found plenty of quotations about
not being understood, and the &quot;little look across the crowd,&quot; and &quot;what is not,
might have been,&quot; and other choice little sentiments, which did not tend to
elevate Mr. Gustav Schröder, then hard at work in the City, in his wife's good
opinion. Indeed, being a very weak little woman, with a parasitical tendency to
cling for support to something, and being without that something, which she had
hitherto found in Barbara, free from the dread which her father's presence
always imposed upon her, and having no companion in her husband, Mrs. Schröder
began to look forward with more and more eagerness to her opportunities of
meeting Charles Beresford, to take greater and greater delight in his attentions
and his conversation, and to substitute a growing repugnance for her hitherto
passive endurance of Mr. Schröder. Charles Beresford was gradually coming to
occupy the principal position in her thoughts, and this that gentleman perceived
with mingled feelings of gratified vanity and annoyance. &quot;She's going a little
too fast!&quot; he had said to himself; &quot;this sort of thing is all very well; but
she's making it a mile too palpable! People will talk, and I'm not in a position
to stand any public scandal; and as for bolting, or any thing of that sort, by
Jove, it would be sheer ruin and nothing less.&quot; In this frame of mind, it had
more than once occurred to Mr. Beresford to speak to Mrs. Schröder, and caution
her as to her bearing towards him; but fortunately for him, so thoroughly void
of offence had been all their relations hitherto, that he scarcely dared to hint
at what he intended to convey, without risking the accusation of imputing evil
by his very advice. And in the mean time, while he hesitated what course to
take, came Dr. Prater's information, which at once changed all his plans.</p>
<p>The day after the conversation at the Flybynights, Mr. Beresford left town
and remained away for a week. The first day after his return, he went into Mr.
Simnel's room at the Office, and found that gentleman as usual surrounded with
work. Contrary, however, to his general custom, Simnel no sooner looked up and
saw Beresford than he threw down the pen which he was plying, rose, and
advancing shook his friend heartily by the hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Glad to see you back, Charley!&quot; he said; &quot;I was afraid you were off for a
ramble by your leaving no message and no address. Some of the old games, eh? You
must give them up now, Master Charley, and live circumspectly; by Jove, you
must.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing of the sort,&quot; replied Beresford. &quot;Gayford, who was chief here before
Maddox, was an old friend of our family; and he's ill, poor old boy, so I went
out of charity to stay with him. He's got a place at Berkhampstead, and there's
deuced good hunting-country round there. I had three capital days; Gayford's
daughters were out; clipping riders, those girls; good as Kate Mellon any day!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Indeed!&quot; said Mr. Simnel, wincing a little at the name: &quot;I should think
flirting with any body's daughters, be they ever so 'clipping,' as you call it,
would be time wasted for you just now, wouldn't it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked Beresford, knowing perfectly, but anxious that the
declaration should come from his companion.</p>
<p>&quot;Mean!&quot; said Simnel, somewhat savagely. &quot;What ant I likely to mean? That you
ought to stick to your duties here and earn your salary; that Sir Hickory has
heard that you go to the Argyle Rooms, and is going to speak to Lord Palmerston
about it; that you're hurting your health or spoiling your complexion by keeping
late hours,--is that why I'm likely to tell you to live circumspectly? What
rubbish it is fencing with me in this way! You know that the last time we met
was at that nightclub of yours; that we had a talk there with Dr. Prater; and
that you determined--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know,&quot; interrupted Beresford with a start--&quot;I know,&quot; he continued, looking
round, &quot;I'm not over particular; but I confess this plotting for a dead man's
shoes seems to me infernal rascality.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean by 'plotting,' Charles Beresford? <i>I</i> am plotting for
no dead man's shoes. <i>I</i> have no hope of marrying a pretty widow, and
having a splendid income; and as for rascality--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There, I didn't mean it; I only thought--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nor, on the other hand,&quot; pursued Mr. Simnel, relentlessly, &quot;am <i>I</i> over
head and ears in debt, pressed by Jews, horribly impecunious, and--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Leave me alone, Simnel, can't you? I know all this; and as you must be
perfectly certain, I've turned this Schröder affair over in my mind a hundred
times already.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And what have you decided?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To go in for it at all hazards.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think you're right,&quot; said Simnel quietly; &quot;it seems to me your last
chance; and though it's not strictly a very nice business, there are hundreds of
men holding their heads up before the world, which very much esteems them, who
have made their money in far worse transactions. You'll require an immense
amount of patience and tact.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The former undoubtedly. Prater said he might go at any moment if--what was
it?--any thing excited or annoyed him. Question is what does excite a fellow of
that sort--Muscovadoes being high, or gray-shirtings scarce, or pig-iron in
demand, or some of those things one sees in the paper--banks breaking or stocks
falling, eh? As for the tact, I don't think that will be required now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How do you mean--<i>now?</i>&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because it's all squared already,&quot; said Beresford complacently. &quot;I've only
to go in and win whenever I like I imagine. To tell the truth--though a man
doesn't talk of these things, of course--I've being fighting shy of it lately,
rather than pressing it on.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, yes, of course,&quot; said Simnel impatiently; &quot;I know all about that; but
don't you see that the greatest tact will be required because your plan of
operations must be entirely changed? You have been carrying on a very animated
flirtation within certain limits; but now you are going in for a totally
different thing. You are going in--sit down, and let us talk this over quietly,
it's rather important: I know you've great experience in such matters; but just
listen to my humble advice, it may be worth hearing,--you are going in to make
sure of marrying a woman after her husband's death; an event likely to occur at
any time. To insure success there are two ways--one by compromising her--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;By Jove, Simnel!&quot; exclaimed Beresford through his shut teeth.</p>
<p>&quot;Be quiet, and don't interrupt--I'm not going to brush the down off your
virtue! As I said, by compromising her, by which you gain a hold upon her which
she cannot shake off, and must always acknowledge and bow to, when required. But
this, besides being wrong and unjust, and all that sort of thing--which I don't
so much mind--is risky, which I dislike; and if detected, brings the whole
fabric to the ground. So we may put that on one side.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; said Beresford, with a sigh of relief; &quot;and the other?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The other is a totally different method, and unlike any thing you have ever
tried, I suspect, with any one. It is simply by professing hopeless, unswerving,
unconquerable spooniness. You have hitherto--pardon the question--merely looked
and sighed, &amp;c.? Ah, I thought so; that gesture was quite satisfactory as to the
amount of tenderness. Well now, then, you must declare yourself. Quietly, of
course, and, if you please, without any manifestations, which would entirely
spoil our plan, the essence whereof is virtue. You declare yourself to this
effect: that you are so completely smitten that you can keep silence no longer;
that previous to going away for a lengthened period (for you believe that
expatriation is the only thing that will afford temporary relief), you have
determined on speaking to her, fearing she might think your absence strange, or
hear its cause wrongly explained by somebody else; that yours is not like the
feeble sentiment of the butterflies who flutter around her, &amp;c. &amp;c.; but a deep
and stedfast passion, which will only cease with life. You know all that
business. Then, that your respect for her is so great, that you will not give
scandal the smallest chance of a whisper. Had you met in happier times--oh! you
did, eh? Well, then, had you been in a position, when you first met, to have
offered, &amp;c.; but now, too late! love for ever; but leave for ever--foreign
climes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes; but you know well enough I can't go abroad, and--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My dear fellow, she'll never dream of your doing any thing of the sort. If
I've any knowledge of women, she'll be deeply affected, as she ought to be by
your deucedly romantic story. She'll say a good deal about 'if,' in reference to
former years; she'll state her full determination to do nothing approaching the
smallest shadow of wrong; but she'll avow she should be miserable at the idea of
being the cause of your banishment, and therefore she'll entreat you to stop in
England and be her brother.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Be her brother?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ay, and a first-rate position you'll have of it as her brother. There'll be
an immense amount of sentiment in the connexion; she'll defer to you in every
thing; your presence will always keep every body else off, and she'll never
dream of carrying on with any one but you. How could she expect again to meet
with such delicacy as you've shown? And if any thing <i>should</i> happen,
you're safe to be first in the field and to carry off the cup. Now do you see
the line of country?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, yes, I see it fast enough, and I've no doubt I can manage it. It's
rather a duffing business altogether; however, needs must, and I musn't risk any
more flukes. One thing I <i>am</i> curious about, Simnel.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What's that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why you take such an interest in this business? You first put me on to it,
and you've evidently given it some of your precious time in thinking it out
while I've been away. Be frank for once in your life, and say--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why does it interest <i>me?</i>&quot; said Simnel, nursing his leg, and giving a
grin which showed all his big teeth. &quot;Well, Master Charley, your memory has
never been good, but you might occasionally recollect that you owe me eight
hundred pounds!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Beresford, &quot;I know that well enough; but it isn't for that alone.
You'll be safe to get that, if I marry and come into money; but there's
something more in it than that, I know. It's that business with the name of that
firm that you made me say to old Townshend, isn't it now, eh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What, Pigott and Wells!&quot; said Simnel, rocking to and fro--&quot;Pigott and Wells
of Combcardingham? Well, perhaps that has something to do with it; who knows?
Meantime, stick to what I've told you; begin at once, and in a month's time come
to me with a good report.&quot;</p>
<p>And so ended the colloquy between this precious pair.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Pursuing his instructions with a certain amount of relish, and all the
experience of an accomplished and versatile actor, Mr. Beresford threw himself
into his new character with spirit, and made a decided hit in it. All the
raillery and nonsense, all the smiles and laughter, had vanished. Owen Meredith
had been exchanged for Lord Byron; and Mr. Beresford as a nineteenth-century
London-made Giaour was doing terrible execution to that feeble little bit of
Mrs. Schröder's anatomy which she called her heart. There was no one to say a
kind word, to give proper advice, to the poor little woman in her need. Barbara
was absolutely lost to her: she had been two or three times to Great Adullam
Street, and Barbara had returned the call; but there was evident restraint on
both sides. The outside show of friendship remained, but there was no animating
spirit; none such, at least, as to call for the kind of confidence which Alice
Schröder would gladly have made, had she received the slightest invitation. But
Barbara was not the Barbara of old days: she looked worn and anxious, was
constantly preoccupied, and answered at random; she confined herself, moreover,
to the merest commonplaces in her conversation, so that Alice got no help from
her. Nor from her father had she any supervision: strict to a fault before her
marriage, Mr. Townshend, having once settled his daughter, imagined that his
duty in life was done, and that henceforth he might devote himself entirely to
pleasure, consisting in haunting the City by day and the whist-tables at the
Travellers by night. And it began to be noticed that this hitherto model British
merchant drank a great deal of wine with his dinner, and a great deal of brandy
after it; and there were ugly rumours running about 'Change and drifting through
Garraway's; and Townshend's clerks were rather in request at the Bay Tree, and
were manifestly pumped as to whether there was any thing wrong with their
governor, under the guise of being requested to &quot;put a name&quot; to what they would
like to drink. It may be imagined, therefore, that under this state of
circumstances Mr. Townshend had neither time nor inclination to bestow any
advice upon that daughter, who, as he was in the habit of saying, &quot;had made such
a splendid alliance.&quot; With her husband Alice had, as has before been said,
nothing in common. He was a cold, proud, well-meaning man, who gloried as much
as a white-blooded elderly person can be said to glory in his riches and his
state, and who liked to have a pretty, elegant, well-dressed woman before him at
table, in the same way that he liked to have a stout big-whiskered butler in a
white waistcoat behind him. He liked his wife, when he had time to think about
her; but he had been brought up in business, and that absorbed his whole
attention by day; while giving or going to parties, in which he could spend the
result of what he had attained by business, occupied him at night. But he had
the highest opinion of Mrs. Schröder's conduct, which he imagined was on a par
with every thing else in the establishment--real and genuine; and he paid her
bills, and presented her with cheques, with lavish generosity. Only he was not
exactly the man on whose bosom a wife could lay her head and confess that she
was tempted beyond her strength.</p>
<p>There was a man who, without being much mixed up with this little episode in
the great drama of human life, overlooked some of the scenes, and saw the
dangers to which one of the characters was rapidly exposing herself. That man
was Fred Lyster, the one sentiment of whose life--his love for Alice
Townshend--was as fresh and as green and as pure as ever. The announcement of
her engagement was a great shock to him, and he had taken care only to meet her
face to face once or twice since her marriage. The meeting upset him; and though
she was apparently unconscious of any feeling in the matter, it did her no good;
and there was no earthly reason why it should be. But he went every where where
she went, and watched her in the distance; his ears were always on the alert
whenever her name was mentioned in club smoke-rooms and suchlike haunts of
gossip; and he found, as he had dreaded with fatal prescience, at Bissett, that
Beresford was on the trail. Long and earnestly he deliberated with himself as to
what course he should pursue. Should he pick a quarrel on some other topic with
Beresford, and shoot him? Shooting had gone out of fashion; and if he killed his
man, he should be exiled from England; if he didn't kill him, where was the use
of challenging him? Should he speak to Mr. Townshend? or was there no female
friend to whom he could apply? Yes; Barbara Churchill. In Barbara Churchill he
had the greatest confidence, and to her he would go at once.</p>

<h5>BARBARA'S FIRST LESSON IN THE MANÈGE.</h5>
<br>
<p>For some few months after the events just described, the lives of those who
form the characters of this little drama passed evenly on without the occurrence
of any circumstance worthy of special record on the part of their historian. Mr.
Beresford, implicitly following Mr. Simnel's advice, proceeded to lay siege to
Mrs. Schröder in the manner agreed upon, and found his advances received very
much after the fashion predicted by his astute friend. In all child-like
simplicity Mrs. Schröder firmly believed in the baneful influence which she had
unconsciously exercised over her admirer, and strove to make him amends by a
charitable and sentimental pity. She could perfectly appreciate all his
feelings; for was not she herself misunderstood? had her girlhood's dream been
realised? what was wealth, what was position, to her? was she not mated with one
who, &amp;c.? So she not merely permitted but encouraged Mr. Beresford's fraternal
sentiments; though she by no means eschewed the world and its frivolity, and
gave herself up to solitary romance. On the contrary, she went out a great deal
into society, and had frequent receptions at home; Beresford being her constant
but always unobtrusive companion. It is difficult to say what motive about this
time prompted a considerable change in Mr. Schröder's manner towards his wife;
but some such change undoubtedly took place. It may possibly have been that the
insufficiency of money as a source of happiness may have dawned upon him,
steeped as he was to his very lips in constantly-increasing wealth. It may have
been that he suddenly awoke to the fact that he was expected to lavish something
more than generosity on the young girl whom he had made the head of his house,
and who, as he thought, conducted herself with so much propriety. This new
feeling may have had its germ one night when they were sitting in their
grand-tier box at the Italian Opera, during the performance of <i>Der Freischütz</i>;
and as the old familiar strains rang through the house, Gustav Schröder's memory
travelled back for five-and-thirty years, and he saw himself a lad of seventeen,
seated in the pit of a little German theatre by the side of a plump little girl,
who wore a silver arrow through the great knot of her flaxen hair, and down
whose cheeks tears were rolling as she listened to the recital of Agatha's woes.
He had loved that plump little Kätchen, loved her with a boy's pure and ardent
passion; and when sent to his uncle's counting-house at Frankfort, they had
parted with bitter tears, and with the exchange of very cheap and worthless
love-tokens. He wondered what had become of that five-groschen piece with the
hole drilled through it, and the bit of red ribbon. He wondered why he had never
loved since those days. And then he looked up and saw his pretty, elegant little
wife, whom every one admired and praised; and it flashed upon him that he had
never tried to break through the outer crust of staid formality with which
business and the world had covered him; and he determined to try to love and be
loved once more. And so Mrs. Schröder, beginning to be dreadfully frightened at
the incantation scene, was astonished to find her hand gently taken in her
husband's, and on looking up to find his eyes fixed on hers. From that time out
Gustav Schröder was a changed man; he took frequent holidays from business; he
strove in every way to let his wife see how anxious he was for her happiness;
and she saw it, and was to a certain extent touched by his conduct. It needed
all Mr. Beresford's sophistry, all his attention and quotation, the employment
of all the art in which he had been indoctrinated by his friend Simnel, to make
head against the influence which Gustav Schröder's quiet watchfulness and
fatherly affection were attaining; for the affection was, after all, more
fatherly than conjugal in its display. Mr. Schröder was far too much a man of
the world to affect to ignore his age or the result of his life-habits; and no
one was better pleased than he to see his wife happy among younger and livelier
companions.</p>
<p>A happy influence properly exercised at this time would have been immediately
beneficial to Alice Schröder, and have brought matters back into the right
course. For instance, ten minutes' walk with Barbara Churchill would have
settled the question; for Barbara was to Alice that one grand idol whom we all
of us (although we change them at different periods of our lives) set up and
worship. And Barbara had not derogated one whit from her high position in
Alice's estimation by her marriage. It was exactly the thing that she imagined a
girl of her friend's high spirit would do, if pressed to it; there was something
romantic in it, savouring of the legends of the high dames of old, who gave
themselves to poets after scorning kings; and the whole process entirely agreed
with certain of the <i>dicta</i> of Mr. Owen Meredith, who, as has been
explained, was poet-laureate at the Schröder court. And Alice called on Barbara,
and petted her and praised her, and in her silly little way did every thing
possible to prevent the smallest <i>rapprochement</i> between them. And then
Alice went away, and cried in the carriage on her way home, and declared that
Barbara was cruel and unkind and unjust, and had utterly changed in every thing.</p>
<p>Were these assertions correct? I fear that at all events they had a certain
proportion of truth. The spirit which had induced Barbara Lexden to marry a man
without money, and of, as her friends thought, inferior position; which had made
her scorn the threats of being cast off by those among whom her life had
hitherto been placed, and to hold to one whom she knew but little, yet trusted
much,--this same spirit made her brave the fate to which she had resigned
herself, and determined that if she repined, it should be in secret and unheard.
It <i>was</i> a mistake; <i>that</i> she had already confessed to herself with
bitter tears many and many a time; done in haste, repented at leisure--the old,
old story, the old seductive myth, which will find believers for ever and aye.
How often, brooding in the solitude of her chamber, had she gone over the whole
business in her mind, linking bit to bit, and endeavouring to find out where the
reality had fallen short of the anticipation!</p>
<p>They were poor. Well! had she not expected poverty; had not Frank told her
plainly and honourably of his position before he made any declaration? Yes; but
she did not understand poverty exactly as she had found it. She knew that they
would not be able to give parties, nor to go to the Opera, nor that kind of
thing; but she certainly thought that they would go out sometimes, and that she
should not be stuck at home for ever. Of course the people who gave parties had
a great deal of expense; but those who went to them had none; and it was not
expected that any newly-married people living in a small way should entertain in
return. But then Frank, after positively refusing to go out a third night
running, had given way; but had shaken his head, and looked so serious over a
glove-bill which he happened to see on her dressing-table, that she threw on her
dressing-gown, and bade him go by himself. She did not care about going out; but
if she went, she would be decent; she had always been considered to have a
reputation for good taste, and nothing on earth should make her a dowdy now. She
would sooner stay at home always; indeed there was little enough to go out for,
having to be jolted in those horrible cabs, that crawled along the streets, with
no room for one's dress, and with the certainty of being covered with dust or
straw, or some dreadful stuff, when you got out; and then the insolence of the
driver!</p>
<p>And her home? It was small, and dull, and dreary; but had she been led to
anticipate any thing else? No; she supposed not. And yet she wore herself out in
those gaunt dark rooms, and chafed in her prison like a bird in its cage. She
had always been a bad correspondent, and since her marriage had scarcely written
any letters at all; but she would sit mooning over the pages of a novel, or over
the stitches of her embroidery, until book or work would fall from her hand; and
there she would remain, looking intently at nothing, staring vacantly before
her. Frank caused her to be supplied regularly with a copy of the <i>Statesman</i>,
and in it she tried to read his articles--an honest attempt in which she
dismally failed. Her aunt had been somewhat of a keen politician, and Barbara
was sufficiently well informed on the position of English parties to bear her
share in a dinner-table dialogue; but foreign affairs principally occupied
Frank's pen in the <i>Statesman</i>; and after an attempted course of reading
about Moldo-Wallachia, Schleswig-Holstein, and the Principalities, including an
immense amount of virtuous indignation, the reason for which she did not
comprehend, and the object of which she could not make out, poor Barbara gave it
up in despair. She was in the habit of glancing occasionally at that portion of
the paper in which Mr. Henchman chronicled the doings of the fashionable world,
and recorded the names of those present at great entertainments; and sometimes
when Barbara would raise her eyes from the paper and look down the hot vista of
frowning houses in Great Adullam Street, where dust and straw were blowing in a
penetrating cloud, and whence the dismal howling of itinerant hucksters fell
upon the ear, she, remembering what part she had recently played among those of
whom she had been reading, and contrasting it with her then life, would bite her
lip until the blood started, and sob bitterly.</p>
<p>Where was her spirit, do you ask? Has she not been represented as a girl of
special spirit and pluck? Did not the early-narrated incidents of her career,
her very marriage, prove this? and is it natural that she should break down
before petty annoyances such as these? These questions have been asked; and all
I can reply is, that I paint according to my lights and to my experience of
life; and I believe that there are hundreds of women of spirit who would bear
the amputation of a finger with more fortitude than the non-arrival of a bonnet,
and who suffer less in separation from those they dearly love than in the
necessity for a daily inspection of the bread-pan.</p>
<p>And Frank, what of him? Had Barbara been deceived in him? had she misjudged
his heart, his truth, his love? Not one whit; and yet how different he seemed!
Throughout his life, Frank Churchill had acted on impulse, and had generally
pulled through with extraordinary success. We have seen how, in the
railway-journey back to Bissett, he had argued with himself, had persuaded
himself into the determination of leaving the place and flying from temptation,
and how on the impulse of a moment he settled the career of his life. To say he
had repented of that step, would have been untrue; equally false would it have
been to say that he had not been seriously disappointed in its result. The great
charm of Barbara Lexden in his eyes had been her dissimilarity from other women.
In the quiet circles in which he moved, there was no one kin to her; she stood
out in bold relief among the fussy wives and meek colourless daughters of his
friends, seeming a being of another sphere. And now, strange to say, this very
contrast which had so captivated him, was his bane. What though the wives were
fussy; they attended to their households with the utmost regularity,
investigating the smallest matters of domestic detail, keeping down expenses
here, making shift there, and having a comfortable home ready for their husbands
wearied out with their work. What though the daughters were meek and colourless,
without a fragment of taste in dress, without a spark of spirit, without one
atom of dash; they were ready to strum the piano, or to play endless games of
whist or picquet, when called upon, to enjoy thoroughly such little society as
they had among themselves, and, in fact, to make themselves generally amiable.
&quot;Their girls did not lollop on the sofa and read trashy novels all day tong, my
dear!&quot; as Mrs. Harding more than once remarked; &quot;they were not aristocrats, and
couldn't jabber Italian; but they didn't lie in bed to breakfast, or be always
fiddling with their hair, or dressing or undressing themselves twenty times a
day. If those were aristocratic manners, the less she had of them the better.&quot;</p>
<p>All this talk, and there was much of it perpetually current, reached Frank
Churchill's ears through his mother, and if it did not render him actually
unhappy, at least dashed his spirits and checked his joys. He would sit for
hours pondering over these things, thinking of his past, when he had only
himself and his old mother to care for, wondering what would have been his
future, supposing he had married one of the daughters of Mesopotamia, and
settled down into the snug humdrum life pursued by those colonists. And then
sometimes Barbara would break in upon his reverie, and, looking so brilliantly
handsome, would come up and kiss his forehead, and say a few loving words
untinged by regret or complaint; and he would rejoice in the choice he had made,
and thank that fortune which had thrown such a treasure in his way.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that, without in the least degree intending it (indeed,
what sacrifice had she not made, would she not make, for her son?), old Mrs.
Churchill was a fruitful cause of the petty dissensions which took place between
Barbara and her husband. Devoted to Frank, to her natural anxiety for his
happiness was superadded an invincible jealousy of the woman who had supplanted
his mother in his regard, or at least had pushed her from the highest position
therein. Against the actuations of this feeling the old lady strove with all her
strength, and made great way; but, like many other intending victors, she
imagined the day gained before the enemy had been thoroughly repulsed, and then,
neglecting her outposts, laid herself open to an irresistible attack. At first
Frank laughed away all these remarks, telling his mother that the difference of
age between her and Barbara, the difference of their lives and bringing up, the
difference in the style of the present time and the days when Mrs. Churchill
lived in the world, caused her to think the young wife's proceedings singular,
and her demeanour odd. But <i>saepe cadendo</i>, by constant trituration the old
lady's notions got grafted into his brain, and most of the weary self-communings
and self-torturings which Frank had, sprung from his mother's unintentional
planting.</p>
<p>One day about noon old Mrs. Churchill knocked at the door of Frank's little
study, and entering found her son hard at work on an article he was preparing
for a review. The old lady seemed in great spirits, kissed her son most
affectionately, and said: &quot;Busy as ever, Frank my darling? As I often used to
say, you'll grow to your desk one day, you stick at it so--at least you used to
when I lived with you; I don't know much of what you do now;&quot; and she gave a
little sigh, made doubly apparent by an attempt to stifle it, as she sat down.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, mum, what nonsense!&quot; said Frank; &quot;you see as much of me as any body
now--as much as Barbara, at all events.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, by the way, how is Barbara?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, not very brilliant this morning; she's got one of her headaches, and I
persuaded her to breakfast in bed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, she didn't take much persuading, I fancy. The young girls nowadays are
very different from what I remember them; but she'd be tired, poor child,
waiting up for you last night.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She did no such thing, I'm delighted to say,&quot; said Frank, smiling, &quot;as I had
to write upon the result of the debate, and didn't get home until nearly three
o'clock. Poor Barbara was sound asleep at that time, and had been so for some
hours.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, ever since her visitor went away, I suppose?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Her visitor? What visitor?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Didn't she tell you? How odd! I called in last evening for a volume of <i>
Blunt on the Pentateuch</i>, and found Captain Lyster here chatting. How odd
that Barbara didn't mention it!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She was too sleepy both last night and this morning, I imagine,&quot; said Frank:
&quot;she has frequently told me of his visits.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, yes, he calls here very often.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He's a very pleasant fellow,&quot; said Frank.</p>
<p>&quot;Is he?&quot; said the old lady, in rather acrid tones. &quot;I didn't think you knew
him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not know him!&quot; exclaimed Frank; &quot;why, mother dear, how on earth should he
call here if I didn't know him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He might be a friend of your wife's, my dear.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But my wife's friends are mine, are they not?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It does not always follow, Frank,&quot; said the old lady calmly; &quot;besides, I
thought if he had been a friend of yours, he would have called <i>sometimes</i>
when you were at home.&quot;</p>
<p>Frank looked up quickly with a flushed face; then said, &quot;What nonsense, mum!
the man is an old friend of Barbara's, and comes at such times as are most
convenient to himself. You don't understand the set of people he lives with,
mum.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very likely not, my dear; and I'm sure I'm not sorry for it; for they seem
strange enough; at least to a quiet old-fashioned body like myself, who was
taught never to receive male friends when my husband--however, that's neither
here nor there.&quot; And Mrs. Churchill bustled out.</p>
<p>When Barbara came down to luncheon, Frank said to her, &quot;I hear you had
Captain Lyster here, last night, Barbara.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; she replied, &quot;I forgot to tell you; he sat here some time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He comes pretty frequently, doesn't he?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; said Barbara, looking up; &quot;I never counted the number of
times; you always hear when he has been.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wish you'd do something for me, Barbara,&quot; said Frank.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, what is it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just tell Lyster it would be better if he could contrive to call when I'm at
home.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why?&quot; asked Barbara pointedly.</p>
<p>&quot;Why--well--upon my word--I scarcely know why--except that people talk, you
know; and it's better--eh? don't you think?&quot; stammered Frank. He had acted on
impulse again, and felt confoundedly ashamed of himself.</p>
<p>&quot;I distinctly decline to do any thing of the sort. I wonder Frank, you're not
ashamed to propose such a thing to me; but I can see what influence has been at
work.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There has been no influence at all; only I choose--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And <i>I</i> choose that you should find a fitter person than your wife to
deliver insulting messages to your friends!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Barbara suppose I were to insist upon your not receiving this man again?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You had better not, Frank,&quot; said she, moving towards the door; &quot;you don't
know whom you have to deal with.&quot; And she swept out of the room.</p>
<p>And this was Barbara's first lesson in the <i>manège</i>.</p>

<h4><a name="div1_25" href="#div1Ref_25">CHAPTER XXV.</a></h4>
<h5>A GARDEN-PARTY AT UPLANDS.</h5>
<br>
<p>Although it was only in the first days of July, it had become thoroughly
evident that the London season was on the wane. After a lengthened period of
inaction, there had been a fierce parliamentary struggle brought about by that
rising young gladiator Mr. Hope Ennythink, who had impeached the Prime Minister,
brought the gravest charges against the Foreign Secretary, accused the
Chancellor of the Exchequer of crass ignorance, and riddled with ridicule the
incompetence of the First Lord of the Admiralty. As Mr. Hope Ennythink spoke
with a certain amount of cleverness and a great amount of brass, as he was
thoroughly up in all the facts which he adduced,--having devoted his life to the
study of Hansard, and being a walking edition of that popular work,--and as he
was warmly supported by the Opposition, whose great leaders thought highly of
the young man, he ran the Government very hard, and gave the Treasury-whips a
great deal of trouble to secure even the slight majority which pulled them
through. But immediately the fight was over, it was evident that the session was
on the point of closing. There was no more excitement; it was very hot weather;
and the session and the season were simultaneously doomed. However, the wives
and daughters of the members were determined to die hard; there would be at
least a fortnight before the prorogation of Parliament, and during that
fortnight dinners, balls, fêtes, and opera-visitings were carried on with
redoubled activity. To a good many, condemned to autumnal pinchings and
scrapings in a dull country-house, it was the last taste of pleasure until next
spring.</p>
<p>Upon the gentlemen attached to the room No. 120, in the Tin-Tax Office, the
general state of affairs was not without its effect. Mr. Kinchenton was away for
his holiday--he generally chose July as the best month for little Percy's
sea-bathing--and he rung the changes between Worthing, Bognor, and
Littlehampton, in one of which places he would be found in an entire suit of
shepherd's-plaid, and always with a telescope slung round him. Mr. Dibb, his
liver in a worse state than ever with the hot weather, had felt himself
compelled to quit the pleasant environs of Clapton, where he ordinarily resided,
and had taken a bedroom at Windmill-Hill, Gravesend, whence he came up to his
office every morning, having immediately established sworn animosity with every
guard and regular passenger on the North-Kent Railway, and having regular
hand-to-hand combats with the man who sat opposite to him, as to whether the
window should be up or down--combats commencing at Gravesend and finishing at
New Cross. Upon Mr. Boppy had come a new phase of existence, he having persuaded
Mrs. Boppy, for the first time since their marriage, to go on a visit to some
country friends, thus leaving him his own master <i>pro tem</i>. And Mr. Boppy
availed himself of this opportunity to give a bachelor-party, cards and supper,
at which Mr. Pringle was the master of the revels, and they all enjoyed
themselves very much, and talked about it afterwards to Mr. Boppy; little
thinking of the unrevealed misery that wretched convivialist was enduring on
account of his being unable to rid the window-curtains of the smell of
tobacco-smoke, by which Mrs. B. would learn of the past symposium, and would
&quot;warm&quot; her husband accordingly. Mr. Prescott and Mr. Pringle had been going on
much the same as usual; and Mr. Crump never went out of town because his pay was
stopped when he was absent from his office, and he never had any friends who
wished to see him.</p>
<p>It was a very hot morning, the sun blazed in through the windows of No. 120,
aid upon the head of Mr. Pringle, who was copying items of account on to a large
ruled sheet of paper.</p>
<p>&quot;Item, every horse for draught or burden--item, each dog, sheep, swine--I'll
be blowed if I'll do any more of it,&quot; said Mr. Pringle, casting down his pen and
rubbing his head. &quot;I must have some soda-water! Prescott, James, was there too
much lemon in Quartermaine's punch last night, or was it that the whitebait are
growing too large to be wholesome? Something was wrong, I know! Crump, my boy,
you're nearest the cellar; just hand me a bottle of the corrective.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Crump certainly was nearest the cellar, which was in fact the cupboard
which should have been his property, but which had been appropriated by Messrs.
Pringle and Prescott as a soda-water store.</p>
<p>&quot;That's a good fellow; now you're up, would you mind just handing me a bit of
ice out of the basin? Thanks! What a good Crumpy it is! What's the matter, Mr.
Dibb?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Can't you be silent for an instant, Mr. Pringle? You are perpetually
gabbling. Can't you let us have a moment's peace?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can generally,&quot; said Mr. Pringle, with an affectation of great frankness;
&quot;but, somehow, not this morning. I seem to be inspired by this delicious fluid.
I think I shall write a book called Songs of Soda-water, or Lays of the Morning
after. That wouldn't be a bad title, would it, Dibb?&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Dibb took no notice of this beyond glaring at Mr. Boppy, who had laughed;
and there was silence for a few minutes, broken by Mr. Prescott, who said, &quot;When
do you go on leave, George?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In September, sir,&quot; replied Pringle. &quot;That's the genial month when the
leaves come off.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where are you going?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That depends upon how much tin I've got. It strikes me, from the present
look-out, that the foreign watering-place of Holloway is about as far as I shall
be able to get. There's a tightness in the money-market that's most infernal.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why don't you apply to your godfather, old Townshend? He's always treated
you with kindness.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes; with un-remitting kindness! wouldn't send me a fiver to save me from
gaol. Oh, no! I'll manage somehow. When are you going?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I wanted a few days in September myself, if I could get away. I've
some shooting offered me at Murray's.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Murray's? Oh, ah! the parent of that nice little girl! je twig. And the
Paterfamilias is a jolly old bird, isn't he, and likes his drink, and has plenty
of money? in which case pater-familiarity does not breed contempt.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They are old friends of my people, you know; and the old gentleman's been
very civil to me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! and the young lady hasn't been rude, has she?--at least I judged not,
from 'what I saw. She rides deuced well; but what a long time she takes to
mount! and when you had swung her to the saddle, I noticed that her reins took
an immense deal of arranging!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't be an idiot, George! you're always fancying things.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you're always fancying girls, and my life's passed in keeping you out of
scrapes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;By the way, do you ever see any thing of--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of <i>the other?</i> Ah, base deceiver! fickle as the wind, or the what's
his name! Yes, I've met poor Kitty once or twice, and, without any nonsense, she
looked thoroughly seedy and worn.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Poor dear Kitty, I'm so sorry! I--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, yes, we know all about it; 'he loves and he rides away,' and all the
rest of it. But, joking apart, Master Jim, it's a very good thing that business
is over. I was really 'afraid at one time you were going to grief. But--hollo!
for me?&quot; These last words thrown off at a tangent to a messenger who entered the
room with a letter.</p>
<p>&quot;No, sir; for Mr. Prescott.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! I don't like letters generally; but that's not a blue one, and looks
tolerably healthy. What's it about, James?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Read for yourself;&quot; and Mr. Prescott tossed the letter over to him.</p>
<p>&quot;Mrs. Schröder--garden fête--Uplands,&quot; said Pringle, reading. &quot;Oh, ah! I knew
all about that, but I didn't mention it, because I wasn't sure that you'd be
asked; and as a certing persing is going, you'd have been as mad as a hatter at
losing the chance of meeting her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What's Uplands?&quot; asked Prescott.</p>
<p>&quot;Uplands is no end of a jolly place which Schröder has taken for the summer
and autumn. He has got some tremendous operation in the mines, or the funds, or
some of those things that those City fellows get so brutally rich with; and he
must be in town two or three times a week. So instead of going to Switzerland,
as he intended, he has rented Uplands, which is about seven miles from town, and
might be seventy. Out north way, through Whittington; stunning Italian villa,
fitted up no end, with conservatories, and big grounds, and a lake, and all
sorts of fun. Belonged to another City buffer, who's over-speculated himself and
gone to Boulogne. That <i>is</i> a comfort; they do go to smash sometimes; but
even then they've generally settled as much as the Chief Commissioner's income
on their wives. Schröder heard of this; pounced upon it at once; and this is to
be Mrs. Schröder's first garden-party.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm very glad I'm asked, if--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Glad you're asked! I should think so; it'll be a first-rate party. There'll
be no shy ices or Cape cup; Gunter does the commissariat; the Foreign Office has
been instructed to send a lot of eligible Counts; and Edgington will supply the
marquee.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was going to say, when you were kind enough to interrupt me, that I'm glad
I'm asked, if Miss Murray is to be there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She'll be there, sir, fast enough; and you shall devote yourself to her, and
be the Murray's Guide; and I'll be your courier, and go before you to see that
all is square. I mean to enjoy myself that day, and no mistake.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p>&quot;This is the place, Jim!&quot; said Mr. Pringle, as on the day of the party they
drove in a hansom along a meadow-bordered road some two miles the country side
of the little village of Whittington. &quot;That's the house, that white building
with the high tower; no end of a smoke-room that tower makes! it's fitted up
with lounges and Indian matting; all the windows hook outwards, and there's a
view all over every where! What a lot of traps, too!--like the outside of the
Star and Garter on a Sunday afternoon. That's the Guards' drag, I suppose; I
know there was a lot of them coming down--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And there's old Murray's carriage; I'd know that any where,&quot; interrupted
Prescott.</p>
<p>&quot;Is it? well, then, you'll be all right. Easy, cabby; we don't want to be
thrown into the very midst of the aristocracy; we'll get out here, and walk
quietly up.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Pringle had by no means given an exaggerated description of the beauties
of Uplands. The house stood on the brow of the hill, under which nestled the
little village of Whittington, the only cluster of buildings within a couple of
miles' range. All round it lay large meadows, through which flowed, in tiny
silver thread, the river Brent; while far away on the horizon lay a thick heavy
cloud betokening the position of Babylon the Great. In the house the rooms,
though somewhat low, were large and cheerful, and the grounds were laid out in
every variety of exquisite taste. There were broad lawns, whereon the
croquet-players loved to linger; and noble terraces where the elderly people
sat, sheltered alike from the sun and the wind; and dark winding shady walks,
down which, at the close of evening, couples would be seen stealing, and being
questioned on their return, would declare that they had been to see the
syringa,--a statement which was invariably received with derision, or, as the
poet hath it, &quot;Doubts would be muttered around, and the name be suggested of
Walker.&quot; And there was a large lake with a real Venetian gondola upon it, very
black and gloomy, and thoroughly realising the notion of a &quot;coffin clapt in a
canoe,&quot; and a large light shallop with an awning, and a couple of outriggers and
a water-quintain for those people who preferred athletics to ease, and
sunstrokes to comfort.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the right sort of thing, isn't it, my boy?&quot; said Mr. Pringle, as
they passed along. &quot;I suppose you could put up with a crib like this, couldn't
you? What a lot of people! every body in London here! How do, doctor? Dr.
Prater, very good little party; took me behind the scenes at the Opera once, and
gave me a certificate when I wanted sick-leave. See that tall man in the fluffy
white hat? Mincing-Lane fellow merchant; named Hill; capital fellow, but drops
his <i>h</i>'s awfully. They call him the <i>Malade Imaginaire</i>, because he
calls himself 'ill when he isn't. That's his wife in the black dress with white
spots on it, like change for a sovereign. Those two tall fellows are in the
Second Life-Guards. Look at the nearest one to us, that's Punch Croker; don't he
look like an ape? I always long to give him a nut: the other man's Charley
Greville, a very good fellow; they tell a capital story about him. His uncle was
a tremendous old screw, who left Charley his heir. When the will was read, the
first clause contained the expression of a hope that his debts would not be
paid. Charley had a copy of this clause sent round to all the creditors, with an
indorsement that he, as executor, would religiously fulfil the desire of the
deceased. There was a terrible scrimmage about it, and the lawyers are at it
now, I believe.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Isn't this our man--Beresford?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course it is, and there's Mr. Schröder close by him. We'll go up and make
our salaams.&quot;</p>
<p>So the young men wound through the crowd, and were very cordially received by
Mrs. Schröder, and indeed by Mr. Beresford. For the Commissioner knew his
popularity in the Office and was pleased at it, and was always glad to meet
decent-looking men belonging to it in society. &quot;It improved the tone of the
confounded place,&quot; he used to say. Talking to Mrs. Schröder was Mr. Sergeant
Shivers, one of the ornaments of the Old-Bailey bar; a tremendously eloquent man
in the florid and ornate style, with a power of cross-examination calculated to
turn a witness inside out, and a power of address able to frighten the jury into
fits; but who scorned all these advantages, and was never so happy as when
talking of and to great people. He was on his favourite topic when Prescott and
Pringle arrived.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, my dear Mrs. Schröder,&quot; he was saying, &quot;isn't it sad? The duchess
herself sent for me, and said, 'Now, Mr. Sergeant, speak to him yourself. You
have experience of life; above all, you have experience of our order. Tell
Philip what will be the result of this marriage with Lady Di!' I promised her
grace I would; and I did. I spoke not only to Lord Philip, but to Lord Ronald
and Lord Alberic, his brothers. But it was no good; the marriage has come off,
and now the poor duchess is in despair. Ah! there's Lady Nettleford! I must go
and condole with her on the affair;&quot; and the learned sergeant bowed himself off.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! 'Good-by to the bar and its moaning,' as Kingsley says,&quot; remarked Mr.
Pringle. &quot;What a dreary bird! Now I see you're fidgetting to be off, Jim; and I
know perfectly well why; so we'll go and look after the Murray. What a pity
she's not got up in red, like her namesakes! then we could recognise her a mile
off.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There she is!&quot; suddenly exclaimed Mr. Prescott. &quot;There! just crossing the
end of the croquet-ground. I'm off, George. I shall find you in plenty of time
to go together;&quot; and Mr. Prescott strode away in great haste.</p>
<p>&quot;Very good,&quot; said Mr. Pringle; &quot;'and she was left lamenting.' I believe I am
in the position of the daughter of the Earl of Ellin; if not, why not? There's
no fair young form to hang upon me; man delights me not nor woman either; so
I'll see if there's any moselle-cup handy.&quot;</p>
<p>Among those present at the Uplands <i>fête</i> were Frank Churchill and
Barbara. Alice Schröder had made a great point of their coming; and though at
first Barbara refused, yet her husband so strongly seconded the invitation, that
she at length gave way and consented. It was a trying time for Barbara: she knew
she would there be compelled to meet many of the members of that old set amongst
which her youth had been passed, and which she had so sedulously avoided since
her marriage, and she was doubtful of her reception by them. Not that that would
have distressed Barbara one jot; she would have swept past the great Duchess of
Merionethshire herself with uplift eyebrows and extended nostrils; but she knew
that Frank was horribly sensitive, and she feared lest any of his sympathies
should be jarred. Moreover, she felt certain that Captain Lyster would be at the
Uplands; and though since the day of the little outbreak his name had not been
mentioned, and all having been made up with a kiss had gone smoothly since,
Barbara had an inward dread that the sight of him would arouse Frank's wrath and
lead to mischief. However, they came. Barbara was very charmingly dressed; and
if her face were a little pale and her expression somewhat anxious, her eye was
as bright and her bearing as proud as ever. Alice Schröder received her in the
warmest manner, kissed her affectionately, and immediately afterwards without
the slightest intention planted a dagger in her breast, by expressing delight at
&quot;seeing her among her old friends again.&quot; &quot;These old friends&quot;--<i>i.e</i>.
persons whom she had been in the habit of constantly meeting in society, and who
had envied and hated her--were gathered together in numbers at Uplands, and all
said civil things to Barbara; indeed, the great Duchess of Merionethshire
actually stepped forward a few paces--a condescension which she very rarely
granted,--and after welcoming Barbara, begged that Mr. Churchill might be
presented to her, &quot;as a gentleman of whom she had heard so much.&quot; Barbara rather
opened her eyes at this; but after the presentation it was explained by the
duchess saying, &quot;My son-in-law, Lord Halley, has often expressed his recognition
of the services rendered to him by your pen, Mr. Churchill.&quot; For Lord Halley was
Foreign Secretary at that time, and certainly gave Churchill plenty of
opportunities of defending him. And as they moved away, Barbara heard the
duchess say, &quot;What a fine-looking man!&quot; and Mr. Sergeant Shivers, who was
thoroughly good-natured, began loudly blowing the trumpet of Frank's abilities.
So that Barbara was happier than she had been for some time; and her happiness
was certainly not decreased by seeing that the cloud had left Frank's brow, and
that he looked in every way his former self.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, Barbara,&quot; said Alice Schröder, approaching them, &quot;we are getting up two
new croquet sets, and want members for each. You'll play, of course? I recollect
how you used to send me spinning at Bissett--oh, by the way, have you heard?
poor dear Sir Marmaduke, so ill at Pau, or somewhere--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ill? Sir Marmaduke ill?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, poor dear! isn't it sad? And Mr. Churchill will play too; but not on
the same side. I can't have you on the same side; you're old married people now;
and both such good players too! Let me see; Captain Lyster, will you take Mrs.
Churchill on your side?&quot;</p>
<p>Captain Lyster bowed, shook hands, and expressed his delight. Frank Churchill
shook hands with Lyster; but as he did so, a flush passed over his face.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, then, that set is full,&quot; said Mrs. Schröder; &quot;who is the captain of the
other set, playing at the other ground? oh, you, Mr. Pringle! Will you take Mr.
Churchill away with you; you only want one, I think?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, madam,&quot; said Pringle, with a serio-comic sigh; &quot;I only want one; but I
shall want that one all my life. Come along, Mr. Churchill.&quot; And he and Frank
started off to the lower lawn together.</p>
<p>Barbara had always been very fond of croquet. She played well; relying more
upon the effectiveness of her aim than the result of her calculations. She had a
perfect little foot; and she croqueted her adversaries far away with as much
science as malice. She enjoyed the game thoroughly, as, not having played for
months, she rejoiced at finding that she retained all her skill; but she could
not help perceiving that Captain Lyster was dull and preoccupied, and that he
attended so little to the game as to require perpetual reminding when it was his
turn to play. Indeed, despite all Barbara's exertions, they might have lost the
game--for their opponents were wary and persevering--had it not been for the
steady play of their coadjutors, Mr. Prescott and Miss Murray, who evinced a
really remarkable talent for keeping close together, and nursing each other
through all the difficult hoops. At length they won with flying colours, and
were going to begin a new game, when Captain Lyster said, &quot;Mrs. Churchill, I
should be so grateful for a few minutes' talk with you on a really important
subject. Please, don't play again, but let us stroll.&quot; Barbara had all faith in
Fred Lyster's truth and honour; she had known him for years, and more than
half-suspected the secret of his early attachment to Alice; so that she had no
hesitation in saying, &quot;Certainly, Captain Lyster, if you wish it;&quot; then adding
with a smile, &quot;You will not miss us much, will you, Mr. Prescott?&quot; she and the
Captain strolled away.</p>
<p>Then, as they walked, Fred Lyster talked long and earnestly. He told Barbara
that he addressed her as one who, he knew, took the deepest interest in Alice
Schröder's welfare; indeed, as one who had been as her sister in times past. He
touched lightly on the disparity in age between Alice and her husband, and upon
the difference in all their habits, tastes, and opinions; he said that she was
thus doubtless driven to her own resources for amusement, and that her utter
simplicity and childishness made her the easy prey of designing people. Then,
with the utmost delicacy, he went on to point out that for some time Beresford's
attentions to Mrs. Schröder had been most marked; that his constant presence at
their house, or in attendance on her when she went out, had attracted attention,
and that at length it had become common club-gossip. Only on the previous night
he had heard that it had been publicly discussed in the smoke-room of the
Minerva; that an old gentleman, an old friend of the family, had announced his
intention of speaking to Mr. Schröder about it. What was to be done? He
(Lyster), deeply pained at it all, had no authority, no influence, no right, to
mix himself with the matter. Would not Mrs. Churchill, in pity for her friend,
talk seriously with Mrs. Schröder about it? She was all-potential. Mrs. Schröder
believed implicitly in her, and would undoubtedly follow her advice. Would not
Mrs. Churchill do this, for pity's sake?</p>
<p>Barbara was very much astonished and very much shocked. She had always known
Alice to be weak and vain and silly; she knew that her marriage with Mr.
Schröder had been one made solely at her father's instigation; but having lived
entirely out of the set for the last few months, she had no idea of the intimacy
with Mr. Beresford, whose acquaintance she considered was by no means desirable.
She was entirely at a loss what to do, being of opinion that her influence over
Alice had all died out. However, if Captain Lyster thought otherwise, and if he
counselled and urged her taking such a step, she would not refuse; she would
take an early opportunity of seeking an interview with Alice, and giving that
silly girl--silly, and nothing more, she was certain--a very serious talking to;
&quot;and then, Captain Lyster, let us trust that this horrible gossip will be put a
stop to.&quot; As Barbara said this, she smiled and put out her hand. Poor Fred bent
over it, and when he raised his head to say, &quot;Mrs. Churchill, you will have done
an angel's work!&quot; there were tears in his eyes.</p>
<p>Meantime Frank Churchill, with doubt and distrust at his heart, engendered by
having to leave Barbara in company with Captain Lyster, went away with Pringle
to the lower croquet-ground, where they and others played a succession of games
with varying success, in all of which Frank distinguished himself by ferocious
swiping, and Mr. Pringle came to grief in an untimely manner. At length, when
they were tired, Frank and Pringle walked away together--the former on the
look-out for his wife, the latter listening with great deference to such scraps
of his companion's conversation as he was treated with; for Mr. Pringle had a
great reverence for &quot;people who write books,&quot; and, in common with a great many,
looked upon the production of a something printable as an occult art. &quot;It always
seems such a rum thing to me,&quot; said he ingenuously, &quot;how you first think about
it, and then how you put it down! You write leaders, Mr. Churchill, eh? Oh yes,
we heard of you at our office, the Tin-Tax, you know! That article in the <i>
Statesman</i> about old Maddox and his K.C.B.'ship, they all declared it was
you.&quot;</p>
<p>As Churchill only said &quot;Indeed!&quot; in an absent manner, and was still looking
about him, Pringle proceeded: &quot;Oh, of course you won't let it out it was your
work--we understand that! but it must be jolly to be able to give a fellow one
for himself sometimes! a regular bad one, enough to make him drink! I should
think that was better fun than novel-writing; though novel-writing must be
easier, as you've only got to describe what you see. I think I could do
that--this afternoon, for instance, and all the swells and queer people about.
The worst of it is, you must touch it up with a bit of love, and I'm not much of
a hand at that; but I suppose one could easily see plenty of it to study from.
For instance, do you see those two at the end of this walk, under the tree? I
suppose that's a spooning match, isn't it? How he is laying down the law! and
she gives him her hand, and he bends over it--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Damnation!&quot; exclaimed Churchill.</p>
<p>&quot;Hollo!&quot; said Pringle, &quot;what's the matter?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing!&quot; said Churchill; &quot;I twisted my foot, that was all!&quot;</p>
<br>
<p>Barbara tried several times that evening to meet Frank; but he avoided her;
and it was not until they were in the fly, that she had an opportunity of
speaking to him.</p>
<p>&quot;Where on earth have you been, Frank, all day? I hunted and hunted for you,
but never succeeded in finding you.&quot;</p>
<p>He looked up at her: her eyes were sparkling, her cheek flushed; she was
thoroughly happy. The escape from Mesopotamia and its dreariness, the return to
scenes similar to those which she had been accustomed to, had worked immediate
change. She looked so radiantly beautiful that Frank was half-tempted to spare
her; but after a second's pause, he said,</p>
<p>&quot;I walked all over the grounds. I was in the shrubbery close by you when
Captain Lyster kissed your hand.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What!&quot; exclaimed Barbara, with a start. &quot;It is beneath me to repel such a
calumny; but to satisfy your absurd doubt, I tell you plainly you were wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Will you tell me,&quot; asked Frank, in a sad voice, &quot;that he did not walk with
yop and talk with you apart? Can you deny it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No!&quot; returned Barbara. &quot;He did both walk and talk with me; he had something
very special to say to me, and he said it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And it was--?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot tell you; it was told to me in confidence; it concerns the
reputation of a third person, and I cannot mention it, even to you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then, by the Lord, I'll have an end to this!&quot; said Frank, in a sudden access
of passion. &quot;Listen here, Barbara; I'll have no captains, nor any one else,
coming to repose confidences with which I'm not to be made acquainted, in my
wife! I'll have no shrubbery-walks and whisperings with you! Such things may be
the fashion in the circles in which you have lived; but I don't hold with them!&quot;</p>
<p>He could have bitten his tongue out the next instant, when Barbara said, in
an icy voice, &quot;It may be the fashion in the circles in which <i>you</i> have
lived to swear at one's wife, and shout at her so that the coachman hears you;
but I don't hold with it, nor, what's more, will I permit it!&quot;</p>
<p>She never spoke again till they reached home, when she stepped leisurely out
of the carriage, ignoring Frank's proffered arm, and went silently to bed.</p>

<h4><a name="div1_26" href="#div1Ref_26">CHAPTER XXVI.</a></h4>
<h5>SHOWING WHO WERE &quot;PIGOTT AND WELLS.&quot;</h5>
<br>
<p>Mr. Simnel, the secretary, sat at his desk, hard at work as usual, but
evidently tempering the dulness of the official minutes with some recollections
of a lively nature, as now and then he would put down his pen, and smile
pleasantly, nursing his knee the while. &quot;Yes,&quot; he said softly to himself, &quot;I
think I'll do it to-day. I've waited long enough; now I'll put Kitty on to the
scent, and stand the racket. <i>Ruat caelum!</i> I'll ride quietly up there this
afternoon;&quot; and he touched the small handbell, with which he summoned his
private secretary. In response to this bell,--not the private secretary, who was
lunching with a couple of friends and discussing the latest fashionable
gossip,--the door was opened by Mr. Pringle, who begged to know his chief's
wishes.</p>
<p>&quot;Eh?&quot; said Simnel, raising his head at the strange voice; &quot;oh, Grammont at
lunch, I suppose?--how do you do, Mr. Pringle? I want all the letters brought in
at once, please; I'm going away early to-day.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly, sir,&quot; said Mr. Pringle, who objected on principle to interviews
with great official swells, such interviews being generally connected in his
mind with rebukes known as &quot;carpetings.&quot; &quot;I'll see about it, sir.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, Mr. Pringle. How are all your people? bow is Mrs. Schröder? who
is your cousin, I think.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, my cousin. She's all right; but I'm sorry to say my uncle Mr. Townshend
is very ill; so ill that he leaves town for the Continent to-night, and is
likely to be away some time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dear me! Pm very sorry to hear that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fact, indeed, sir! I was thinking, sir,&quot; said Mr. Pringle, who never missed
a chance, &quot;that as Mrs. Schröder may perhaps be rather dull to-morrow after her
father's gone, I might perhaps have a day's leave of absence to be with her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly; by all means, Mr. Pringle! Now send in the letters, please.&quot; And
Mr. Pringle retired into the next room, where he indulged in the steps of a
comic dance popular with burlesque-actors, and known as a &quot;nigger break-down.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Going out of town, eh? likely to be abroad some time! very unwell!&quot; said Mr.
Simnel, nursing his leg; &quot;then I must alter my arrangements. I'll go and see him
at once, and bring that matter to a head. I can deal with Kitty afterwards.&quot; And
when Mr. Simnel had signed all the letters brought in to him, he unlocked his
desk and took out a paper which he placed in his pocketbook; then carefully
locking every thing after him, he departed.</p>
<p>In the Strand he called a cab, and was driven to Austin Friars, where he
dismounted, and walked up the street until he came to a large door, on the posts
of which were inscribed the words, &quot;Townshend and Co.&quot; There was no Co., there
never had been; Mr. Townshend was the entire concern; he was the first of his
name who had been known in the place, and no one knew his origin. He first made
his mark in the City as a daring money-broker and speculator; two or three lucky
hits established his fame, and he then became cautious, wary, well-informed, and
almost invariably successful.. The name of Townshend was highly thought of on
'Change; its owner had been invited to a seat in the Bank Direction, and had
been consulted by more than one Chancellor of the Exchequer; he had been a
member of the Gresham Club, there made acquaintances, who introduced him into
the True Blue and the No-Surrender, for Mr. Townshend was intensely
conservative; and by the time his daughter was fit to head his table (his wife
had died years since), he had a set of ancestors on his walls in Harley Street
dating from warriors who fought at Ramillies and Malplaquet, down to the &quot;civil
servant of the Company,&quot; who shook the pagoda-tree in the East, and from whom,
as Mr. Townshend said, his first start in life was derived. It is doubtful--and
immaterial--whether Mr. Simnel knew or not of the non-existence of the Co. He
asked for Mr. Townshend, whether Mr. Townshend was in; and he put the question
to one of four young gentlemen who were writing at a desk, which, if it must be
called by its right name, was a counter. After a great deal of fencing with this
youth, who was reading out wild commercial documents, such as &quot;Two two four
nine, Lammas and Childs on National of Ireland--note for dis.,&quot; and who declined
to be interrupted until he had completed his task,--Mr. Simnel at length got his
name sent in to Mr. Townshend, and was shown into the great man's presence.</p>
<p>Mr. Townshend was seated at a large desk covered with papers, which were
arranged in the most precise and orderly fashion. He was dressed with great
precision, in a blue body-coat and a buff waistcoat with gilt buttons; his thin
hair was brushed up over his temples, and his face was thin and pale. He
received his visitor somewhat pompously, and made him a very slight bow. Mr.
Simnel returned the salute much in the same fashion, and said, &quot;You will wonder
what has brought me to call on you, Mr. Townshend?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I--I am not aware what can have procured me the honour of a visit,
Mr.--Mr.--&quot; and the old gentleman held up Mr. Simnel's card at arm's-length, and
looked at it through his double eyeglass.</p>
<p>&quot;Simnel's my name! I daresay it conveys to you no meaning whatsoever?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I beg your pardon! On the contrary, your name is familiar to me as that
of the secretary of the Tin-Tax Office. I am glad to make your acquaintance,
sir. I often have communication with official men. What can I do for you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's in a private capacity that I've come to see you,&quot; said Mr. Simnel. &quot;I
heard you were going out of town, and I had something special to talk over with
you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I must trouble you to be concise and quick,&quot; said Mr. Townshend, by no means
relishing the easy manner of his visitor. &quot;As you say, I am going out of
town,--for the benefit of my health,--and every moment is precious.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I shall not detain you very long,&quot; said Simnel, who had begun to nurse his
leg, to Mr. Townshend's intense disgust. &quot;I suppose we're private here? You'll
excuse me; but you'll be glad of it before I've done. I may as well be brief in
what I have to say; it will save both of us trouble. To begin with: I'm not by
origin a London man. I come from Combcardingham; so do you.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Townshend's cheeks paled a little as he said, &quot;I came from Calcutta sir.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes; last, I know; but you went to Calcutta, and from Combcardingham.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I never was in the place in my life.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Weren't you indeed? then it must have been your twin-brother. I know a
curious story about him, which I'll tell you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you are come here to fool away my time, sir!&quot; said Mr. Townshend, rising.</p>
<p>&quot;By no means, my dear sir. You don't know me personally; but I'll pledge my
official reputation that the story is worth hearing. I think when I mention the
names of Pigott and Wells--&quot;</p>
<p>Down at last--sunk down cowering in his chair, just as at the Schröders'
dinner, when he heard those dreadful names.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, I thought you would remember them. Well, Pigott and Wells were
wool-merchants of old standing in Combcardingham. Pigott had long been dead; but
Wells carried on the business of the firm under the old name. His solicitors
were Messrs. Banner and Blair. One day Mr. Banner came to their articled clerk,
and said to him, 'Robert, I have got an awkward business on hand; but you're a
sharp fellow and can be trusted. Old Wells is coming here presently with some
one else. I shall want a signature witnessed; but I'll get Podmore to do that.
All you have to do is to keep your eyes against that window,' pointing to a pane
hidden behind a curtain; 'and mark all you see, specially faces. It may be a
lesson to you on a future occasion.'&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, sir?&quot; interrupted Townshend.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, sir, the clerk placed himself as directed, and saw old Mr. Wells and a
thickset, dissipated-looking man shown into the room. Banner told Mr. Wells he
was prepared for him, and produced a paper for signature; the signer of which,
in consideration of Mr. Wells consenting to forego prosecuting him for the
forgery of a bill of 120<i>l</i>. attached to the document, promised to leave
England and never to return. You're interested now; I thought you would be.
Podmore was called in, and witnessed the dissipated young man sign the paper;
but he knew nothing of its contents. Then old Wells, raising his shaking
forefinger, said, 'For your poor mother's sake, sir; not for yours!' and the
dissipated-looking man drew a long breath, as though a great weight were off his
mind, and strode out. The articled clerk saw all this, and marked the features
of the forger; he did not see him again for many years. He sees him now!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Simply, that you were the forger, I the clerk!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But that paper--that horrible confession, and the bill, they are destroyed!
Wells swore he would destroy them before his death!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He intended to do so but he died suddenly, poor old man; and in going
through his desk I found them. I've got them here!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And what use are they to you? What harm are they to me? I shall swear--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Stop a minute! Podmore is alive; he's got Banner and Blair's business in
Combcardingham now; he would verify his signature any day, and yours too. No; I
fairly tell you I've thought of it all for several years, and I don't see your
loophole. I think I've got you tight!&quot; And Mr. Simnel smiled pleasantly as he
squeezed his thumb and forefinger together, as though he were choking a rabbit.</p>
<p>Mr. Townshend was cowering in his chair, and had covered his face with his
hands. When he raised it, he was livid. &quot;What do you want?--money?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Simnel, &quot;not exactly. Oddly enough, I want nothing at present! I
merely wanted, as you were going out of town, to set matters straight, and let
us understand each other before you left. I'll let you know when I really
require you to do something for me, and you'll not fail, eh?&quot; These last words
rather sharply.</p>
<p>&quot;In all human--I mean--in a--&quot; and the old man stammered, broke down, and
threw himself back in his chair, sobbing violently.</p>
<p>&quot;Come, come!&quot; said Simnel; &quot;don't take on so! You'll not find me hard; but
you know in these days one must utilise one's opportunities. There, good-by! you
won't forget my name; and I'll write here when I want you.&quot;</p>
<p>And he touched, not unkindly, the shrinking old man's shoulder, and went out.</p>
<br>
<br>

<h4><a name="div1_27" href="#div1Ref_27">CHAPTER XXVII.</a></h4>
<h5>WEAVING THE WEB.</h5>
<br>
<p>In his well-deserved character of prudent campaigner, Mr. Simnel took no
immediate steps to avail himself of the signal advantage which he had gained in
his interview with Mr. Townshend. That eminent British merchant went abroad, and
his name was recorded among a choice sprinkling of fashionables as honouring the
steamship <i>Baron Osy</i>, bound for Antwerp, with their presence, and, on the
&quot;better-day-better-deed&quot; principle, selecting the Sunday as the day of their
departure. Mr. Simnel read the paragraph with a placid smile; he had seen
sufficient of Mr. Townshend in that interview to guess that his illness was
merely the result of care and worry, and that there was no reason to apprehend
his proximate death. Antwerp--doubtless thence Brussels, the Rhine, and perhaps
Switzerland--would make a pleasant tour; and as for any idea of escape, he knew
well enough that that thought had never crossed Mr. Townshend's mind. The old
gentleman knew he would have to pay the possessor of his secret heavily in one
way or another, but in what he was as yet totally ignorant; besides, his
business engagements in London utterly prevented all chance of his retiring in
any sudden manner. And so Mr. Simnel remained quietly at his post at the Tin-Tax
Office, apparently not taking any notice of any thing save the regular business
routine, but in reality intent on his earnest cat-like watching of all around
him, and always ready to pull any string at what he considered the proper
opportunity.</p>
<p>He kept his eyes on Mr. Beresford, and knit his eyebrows very much as he
contemplated that gentleman's proceedings. Whether prompted by anxiety for the
fate of his eight-hundred pounds loan or by some other occult reason, Mr. Simnel
had been specially watchful over the Commissioner, and urged upon him to bring
the speculation in which he had embarked to a prosperous close. With this view
he had dissuaded Beresford from going to Scotland, whither, as usual, he was
bound on his autumnal excursion; representing to him that he had of late been
very lax in his attendance; that he had had much more leave of absence than any
of his brother commissioners; that Sir Hickory Maddox had once or twice referred
to the subject in any thing but a complimentary manner; and that the best thing
he could do to stave off an impending row would be to volunteer to stop in town,
and let the other members of the board have a chance of running away in the fine
weather. At this suggestion Mr. Beresford looked very black and waxed very
wroth, and couldn't see why the deuce, and on his oath couldn't tell the
necessity, &amp;c.; but relented somewhat when his friend pointed out to him that
there was no necessity for his attending more than twice a week at the office,
just to sign such papers as were pressing; and that instead of remaining in his
South-Audley-Street lodgings, he could go out and take rooms at a beautiful
little inn in the village of Whittington, where there was a glorious cook, a
capital cellar, beautiful air, splendid prospect, and above all, which was
twenty minutes' canter from the Uplands, Schröder's summer place. To this plan
Mr. Beresford consented; and after asking for a further loan of fifty, and
getting five-and-twenty, from Simnel, Beresford and his mare Gulnare were
domesticated at the Holly Bush, and he prepared to make play.</p>
<p>But somehow the state of affairs did not please Mr. Simnel. One day, when he
and Mr. and Mrs. Schröder were Beresford's guests, he seemed specially annoyed;
and on the next occasion of his friend's visiting the office, he took the
opportunity of speaking to him.</p>
<p>&quot;I want to say a word to you, Master Charles,&quot; said he, entering the
board-room and addressing Beresford, who was stretched on the sofa reading the
<i>Post</i>, and envying the sportsmen whose bags were recorded therein. &quot;I want
to know how you're getting on.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Getting on! in what way?&quot; asked Beresford, putting down the paper and lazily
looking round; &quot;as regards money, do you mean? because, if so, I could take that
other five-and-twenty from you with a great amount of satisfaction.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're very good,&quot; said Simnel, with a sardonic grin; &quot;but I'd rather not.
I'm afraid you've been trying some of Dr. Franklin's experiments with kites
again recently; at all events, I've seen several letters addressed to you in
Parkinson's--of Thavies Inn, I mean--handwriting; which looks any thing but
healthy. However, I didn't mean that; I meant in the other business--the great
venture.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; said Beresford, &quot;that's all right.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm glad to hear it. Satisfactory, and all that sort of thing, eh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Perfectly. Why do you ask?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, to tell you the truth,&quot; said Simnel, with that kind of honest
bluntness, that inexpressible frankness, generally assumed by a man who is going
to say something disagreeable, &quot;I had an idea that it was quite the opposite.
When we dined with you the other day,--deuced good dinner it was too; I was
right to recommend you there, wasn't I? I haven't tasted such spitchcocked eels
for years; and that man's moselle has a finer faint flavour of the muscat than
any I know in England,--when we dined with you, as I say, I fancied things were
all wrong with the lady. I talked to the old boy, as in duty bound, and listened
to all his platitudes about the influence of money--as though I didn't know
about that, good lord! But the whole time I was listening, and chiming in here
and there with such interjections as I thought appropriate, I kept my eye on you
and madam; and from what I saw, I judged it wasn't all plain-sailing. I was
right; wasn't I?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Mr. Beresford, between his teeth, &quot;you were, and that's the
truth. We've come to grief somehow; but how, I can hardly tell. It was going on
splendidly; I had followed all your instructions to the letter, and, in fact, I
was thoroughly accepted as her brother, when she suddenly veered round; and
though I can't say she's been unkind, yet she has lost all that warmth that so
pleasantly characterised her regard; and now, I think, rather avoids me than
otherwise.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You've not overdone it, have you? Not been lapsing into your old style of
flirtation, and--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No; on my honour, no. I rather think some of her friends have been putting
the moral screw on. You recollect a Miss Lexden--Mrs. Churchill that is now?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Perfectly! But <i>she</i> would not be likely to object to a flirtation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not as mademoiselle, but as madame she has rangéed herself, and I believe
her husband is a straight-laced party. She was up at Uplands for a couple of
days, and rather snubbed me when I presented myself there in my fraternal
character. I've been putting things together in my mind, and I begin to think
that Mrs. Schröder's coldness dated from Mrs. Churchill's visit.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Likely enough. I daresay Mrs. Churchill goes in tremendously now for all the
domestic virtues. If a reformed rake makes the best husband, a penitent flirt
ought to make the best wife; and, by all accounts, Miss Barbara Lexden was a
queen of the art. I hear that she and her husband lead a perpetually
billing-and-cooing existence, like a pair of genteelly-poor turtles, in some
dovecot near Gray's Inn.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That man Lyster's been a good deal to the house lately, too. I always hated
that fellow, and I know he hates me; he looks at me sometimes as though he could
eat me. Schröder seems to have taken a fancy to him; and I sometimes half fancy
that he has a kind of spoony attachment to Mrs. Schröder--if you recollect, I
told you I thought he was after her when we were all down at Bissett--though I
don't think very much of that. I'll tell you what it is, Simnel,&quot; continued Mr.
Beresford, in a burst of confidence, straggling up into a sitting position on
the sofa, and beating his legs with the folded newspaper as he spoke, &quot;I'm
getting devilish sick of all this dodging and duffing, and I've been thinking
seriously of calling my creditors together, getting them to take so much a-year,
and then going in quietly and marrying Kate Mellon after all.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Simnel's face flushed but for an instant; it was its normal colour when
he said,</p>
<p>&quot;You're mad! You, with the ball at your foot, to think of such a course! So
much a-year, indeed! Butchers and bakers do that sort of thing, I believe, when
they've been let in; but not forty-per-cent men; not money-lending
insurance-offices. Breathe a hint of your state, and they'd be down upon you at
once, and sell you up like old sticks. Besides, you couldn't come to any
arrangement with your creditors without its leaking out somehow. It would get
into those infernal trade-circulars, or protection-gazettes, or whatever they're
called; and if the Bishop or Lady Lowndes heard of it, all your chances of
inheriting in either of those quarters would be blown to the winds. As to--to
Kate Mellon, you may judge how your alliance with her would please either of the
august persons I have named.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Jove! you're right,&quot; said Beresford, biting his nails.</p>
<p>&quot;Right, of course I am; and here you've only to wait, and an heiress--a
delightful little creature to boot--is absolutely thrown into your arms. You're
a child, Charley, in some things,--you clever men always have a slate off
somewhere, you know,--and in business you're a positive child. Can't you see
that yours must be a waiting race?--that you mustn't mind being hustled, and
bothered, and cramped, at the beginning, but must always keep your eyes open for
your chance, and then make the running? The least impetuosity, such as you hint
at, would throw away every hope, and destroy a very excellently planned scheme.
Oh, you needn't wince at the word; we are all schemers in love, as well as in
every thing else, if we only acknowledged it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then you counsel my keeping on still, and endeavouring to regain my
influence?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly; by all means. It will come back, never fear. And look here,
Charley; don't fall into that horribly common and vulgar error of abusing the
people who are supposed to be thwarting your plans. Be specially kind, on the
contrary, in all you say of them. This Captain Lyster, for instance, I should
proclaim, if I were you, a thorough gentleman--a prolix chevalier of a type now
seldom seen--a man evidently smothering an unhappy passion for--for--any body
but Mrs. Schröder. Wouldn't the other one do? Mrs. Churchill, I mean.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do! What do you mean? There used certainly to be a flirtation between them
at one time, and--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Quite enough. Only keep Mrs. Schröder from the notion that Lyster is
spooning her; for that's enough at once to turn her silly little thoughts to
him. Speak kindly of every one; and don't show the smallest signs of weariness,
depression, or discouragement.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p>When Mr. Simnel returned to his own room, he settled himself down into his
chair, and fell to nursing his leg and thinking, with the old sinister smile on
his face.</p>
<p>&quot;He's not the easiest fellow in the world to deal with--Beresford! At least,
he'd be difficult to some; but I think I've got him in hand. Wants every thing
to run slick off the reel at once, the idiot! As though any great coup had ever
been pulled off, save by waiting, and watching, and patience. Marry Kate Mellon,
indeed!&quot; and here Mr. Simnel's fingers, intertwined across his knee, cracked as
he pulled at them--&quot;marry Kate Mellon, and with such a damned air of patronage
too! No, my young friend, never! You held a trump-card there, and you neglected
to play it; and in my game there's no revoking. I must see Kitty, and look how
the land lies. I think I've stalled Master Charley off for some little time; and
it's no use bringing about an éclaircissement of the Schröder business; which
Kitty would be safe to do as soon as she had any tangible proof. Then I should
lose my eight hundred pounds in Charley Beresford's general and helpless smash.
But I'd sooner drop them than miss my chance of Kitty. Slippery,
though--slippery as the deuce!&quot; and Mr. Simnel put his elbow on his knee, and
his face into his hand, and sat plucking at his chin &quot;hankers after Beresford,
no doubt,--I think has a liking for that young Prescott; but that I'll put a
stop to to-day,--and I suppose only thanks me for my kindness. And yet I can put
the finishing stroke to the whole thing in one moment; only want the one
connecting-link and the story's complete; and then I'll take my oath she'll have
me. I'll ride up there this afternoon, and just see how the land lies.&quot;</p>
<p>In accordance with this determination, Mr. Simnel that afternoon mounted his
thoroughbred and cantered off to The Den. He found the mistress of the house at
home, seated on a rustic seat, in a little grass-plot in front of the
drawing-room window, with a carriage-whip in her hand, with which she was
flicking the heads off such flowers as were within reach. She had evidently just
come in from a drive, for she still wore her bonnet and black-lace shawl, though
the former was perched on the top of her head, to keep off the sun, while the
latter hung trailing down her back. She had altered in appearance, and not for
the better: her eyes were unnaturally bright; her cheeks sunken, and marked here
and there with hectic patches. Simnel gave his horse to a groom, and walked up
the garden-path. Kate Mellon looked up at the sound of his advancing footsteps;
at first vacantly enough, but when she recognised him, she roused herself, and
got up to meet him.</p>
<p>&quot;How are you Simnel?&quot; she said, with outstretched hand. &quot;I was thinking of
you only to-day, and wondering what had become of you. It's ages since you've
been up here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I've been very busy, Kate, and been unable to come. You know my wish is to
come as frequently as possible; oh, you needn't shake your head, because you are
quite certain of it; but that's neither here nor there. I keep to my portion of
the contract, and shall not bore you about myself until I've shown you I've a
right to ask you to listen to me. And now, how are you, and what are you doing?
To tell truth, I don't think you look very bonny, young woman: a little dragged,
eh? End of the season, perhaps?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I'm all right!&quot; said Kate, hurriedly; &quot;never better in health, and
jolly; that's the great point, isn't it, Simnel, eh? I'm learning to look after
number one, you know; and when you can do that, you're all right, ain't you?
Have some lunch? No? then look here; I've got something you must taste,--some
wonderful Madeira. Oh, all right; I know it'll put some colour into your cheeks,
and do you good.&quot;</p>
<p>She called to a passing servant, and the wine was brought,--rare old tawny,
full-bodied, mellow Madeira,--such wine as is now to be met in about a dozen
houses in the land, and utterly different from the mixture of mahogany-shavings
and brandy which is sold under its name. Simnel poured out two half-glasses; but
Kate took the decanter from him, filled her glass to the brim, and nodding to
him, drank off half its contents.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; said she, with a long-drawn inspiration; &quot;that's the stuff! No nonsense
in that, you know; doesn't pretend to be what it isn't, and can't deceive you.
Tom Gillespie sent me a lot of that: found no end of it in the cellars of his
old uncle, the East-India Director, whose tin he came in for. I find it does me
good, steadies my nerve, and gives me fresh life. What are you shaking your head
at?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's dangerous tipple, Kate. I don't like to hear you talk like that. Your
nerves used to be as strong as steel, without any steadying. I say, Kitty,&quot; said
Mr. Simnel with a grave face; &quot;you're not giving way to this sort of thing
for--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;For what?&quot; interrupted Kate, with a discordant laugh; &quot;for comfort? Oh, no,
thank you; I don't want that yet: I don't want to drown my sorrows in the bowl.
I haven't got any sorrows, and I shouldn't do that with them if I had. By the
way, Simnel, how is that affair going on,--you know what I mean? You promised to
let me know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I believe it stands very much the same as it did,&quot; said he.</p>
<p>&quot;Then it hasn't worn out yet? he isn't tired of it, eh?&quot; she asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&quot;No; it still goes on.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You promised to tell me the woman's name, Simnel; why haven't you done so?
You pretend friendship for me, and then you keep things from me that I ought to
know; and you don't come and see me, and,--There, I don't believe in you a bit!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I keep things from you until the proper time for you to know them. I don't
come and see you, because all the leisure time I have had has been devoted to
your interests; and, by the way, Kate, that brings me to the occasion of my
present visit. I suppose you give me credit for sincerity--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, ah; well, what then?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I mean that you believe in me sufficiently to think that any step I should
take, any question I should ask, would not be out of mere idle curiosity; but
because I thought they would be beneficial to you?&quot;</p>
<p>She nodded her head, and stretched her hand towards the decanter; but seeing
Simnel frown, she stopped short, took up the whip which lay close by, and
commenced flicking the flowers again.</p>
<p>&quot;I want to ask you about your people,&quot;--the girl started;--&quot;who they are;
where you came from; what you know of them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You know all that fast enough,--from Yorkshire,--you've heard me say before.
What more's wanted to be known? I pay my way, don't I, and who does more? I'm
not required to show my christening certificate to every one that wants a horse
broke, I suppose?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What a fiery child it is!&quot; said Simnel. &quot;No one has a right to ask any thing
at all about it,--I least of all; but I think,--and I am not sanguine, you
know--that I shall be able, if you will confide in me, to help you very greatly
in the most earnest wish of your life.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Stop!&quot; exclaimed Kate; &quot;do you know what that is?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think I do,&quot; said Simnel, looking at her kindling eyes, quivering nostril,
and twitching lips.</p>
<p>&quot;If not, I'll tell you; I don't mind telling you: revenge on Charles
Beresford! revenge! revenge!&quot; and at each repetition of the word she slashed
savagely at the tall flowers near her.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I think I might say I could help you in that,&quot; said Simnel quietly;
&quot;but you must be frank. You know I'm a man of the world; and I've made it my
business to go a little into this question. So now tell me your life, from the
first that you can remember of it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're a cool hand, Simnel but I know you mean running straight, so I don't
mind. First thing of all I can recollect is being held out at arm's length by
Phil Fox, as the child in his great trick-act of Rolla, or the something of
Peru. The circus belonged to old Fox, Phil's father; and I used to live with the
Foxes,--the old man and woman and Bella Fox, and Phil and his wife. Bad lot she
was: had been a splendid rider, but fell and broke her leg; and was always
vicious and snappish, and that irritating, I wonder Phil could put up with her.
They were very kind to me, the Foxes, and I was quite like their own child; and
I played fairies, and flower-girls, and columbines, and such like, all on
horseback, in all the towns we went circuit. I used to ask the old man sometimes
about myself; but he never would say more than that I was his little apprentice,
and I should find it all right some day. And so I went on with them till I grew
quite a big girl, and used to do the barebacked-steed business, and what I liked
better, the riding-habit and the highly-trained charger dodge, until old Fox
declared there was no better rider in England than me. I was just nineteen, when
he sent for me one night,--it was at Warwick, I recollect, and we'd had a
stunning house,--and I found him with two gentlemen standing with him. He
pointed to one of them, and he said to me: 'Express'--that's the name he used to
call me,--'Express, this is the gentleman that bound you 'prentice to me ever so
many years ago. He's come to take you away now, and make your fortune.' I cried,
and said I didn't want my fortune made, and that I wouldn't go; but after a long
talk full of business, I saw it would be for my good, and I agreed. So this
place was bought for me in my name, and here I've been ever since.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And who were those gentlemen?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's exactly what I can't tell you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Can't tell?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Won't, if you like it better. There, don't look vexed. I'll tell you this
much, one of them was my uncle,--my real uncle, I firmly believe,--though on
which side you must find out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And the other?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The other I love dearer than any one on earth.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dearer than you loved--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know who you're going to say; infinitely dearer! but in--there; there's
enough of that. One thing more I'll tell you: up to this hour I've never been
told my father's name or rank in life.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And this benevolent uncle did it all? Quite like a play, by Jove! Well, I've
not learned much; but I may be able to make something of it--something that will
be good for us both.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's all right! and now your business is finished?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, entirely--no, not quite, by the way; I wanted to say one word to you on
another subject. You know I'm not likely to be jealous Kitty--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So far as I'm concerned, you've no right to be.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know, of course; but still one doesn't like these things. There's a young
man named Prescott, who is in my office. I notice that he's constantly in your
company; I've met you with him half-a-dozen times, and I hear frequently from
others of his being with you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What of that?&quot; she asked, with flushing cheek; &quot;are you to settle my company
for me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not at all--not at all; but I'm speaking both for your good and his. He's a
young fellow of good abilities; but he's thoughtless and foolish, and, what's
worse than all, he's poor. Now this riding about, horse-hiring and that sort of
thing, necessarily leads him into expense; and from what I hear, he's going a
great deal too fast. I hear all sorts of things about the young fellows who are
under me, and I'm told that your friend Mr. Prescott is getting involved in
money-matters; in fact, that he's mixed up in bill-transactions to an amount
which, for him, is heavy, with a blood-sucking rascal named Scadgers, who is one
of the pests of society in general, and government offices in particular.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Scadgers!&quot; replied Kate; &quot;what a funny name! Scadgers, eh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A good many people have found it any thing but a funny name, Kitty. Now,
though I don't suppose there's any thing between you and Mr. Prescott--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't you trouble any more about that; perhaps you've never noticed that Mr.
Prescott never is with me except when one of my pupils is there too: now do you
understand?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There was no pupil nor any one else with you when I saw him talking to you
in the Row some twelve months since; and he scuttled off as I rode up: however,
I thought I'd warn you about him. He's on the downward road, and unless he pulls
up, he'll come to grief; and it wouldn't do for you to be mixed up in any thing
of that sort.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p>He sat some time longer talking of ordinary matters, and rattling on in his
best style. In every thing he said there was a tinge of attention almost
bordering on respect to his companion, which she did not fail to notice, and
which decidedly impressed her in his favour. Indeed, Kate Mellon never had
imagined that Mr. Simnel could have made such progress in her good graces as he
did this day. They never recurred to any serious topic until his horse was
brought, when just as he was mounting she touched him on the shoulder, and said,
&quot;You'll not forget to keep me up to the mark about that business?&quot; then, with a
half-shuddering laugh, &quot;I'm still interested, you know, in that young man's
progress.&quot; Simnel wheeled round and looked at her steadily under his bent
eyebrows. &quot;You shall be made acquainted with any thing that happens, depend upon
it. Adieu!&quot; and he sprang to the saddle, raised his hat, and rode slowly off.</p>
<p>&quot;Not half cured yet,&quot; said he to himself, &quot;not half; and yet so savage at his
slight, that she'd do him any bad turn on the spur of the moment, and repent of
it instantly. She was telling truth about Prescott, I know; but it was best to
break up that instantly. How lovely she looked! a little flushed, a little
excited; but that only added to her charm. I didn't like that Madeira being so
handy, by the way; I must look after that. By Jove, what a fairy it is! where's
there one to compare to her? so round and plump and well put together! And if I
can only square this family history--uncle, eh? who the deuce can that have
been? That's an important link in the chain. And somebody she loves, too; what
the deuce does that mean? Ah, well, it's coming to a head now: another month
ought to enable me to pull up the curtain on the last act of the drama.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p>And Kate returned to her garden-chair as the sound of the horse's hoofs died
away in the distance; and throwing herself back, and drumming with her fingers
upon the little table, went off into a reverie. She thought of her devotion to
Beresford; how the passion had first grown when he first knew her; how she had
given way to it; and how the nourishment of it was one of the brightest phases
in her strange odd life. She remembered the first time she saw him, the first
compliment he paid her; the way in which his easy jolly behaviour struck her as
compared with the dreary vapidity, or, what was worse, the slangy fastness of
the other men of her acquaintance. And then she thought of that eventful evening
when she had knelt at his feet and--she dashed her clenched fist upon the table
as she remembered that, and shuddered and bit her lips when she thought that a
description of that scene had been given amid ribald shouts. Mr. Simnel had not
so much share of her thoughts as probably he would have wished; but she pondered
for a few moments on his eagerness to obtain particulars of her early life, and
wondered what scheme he had in hand. She had a very high opinion of his
intellect, and felt sure he was using it just then in her service; but she could
not conceive to what end his labours were tending. And then she remembered what
he had said about Mr. Prescott; and her face grew a little sad.</p>
<p>&quot;Poor Jim!&quot; she said to herself; &quot;poor fellow! going to grief, is he? in debt
and dropping his money, like a young fool as he is. And that nice girl, too, so
fresh and jolly and countrified and innocent! Lord help us! What are you at,
Kitty, you idiot why should those things give you a twinge? Steady, now; it's
not often your heart buck-jumps like that. They'll go all right, those though,
if Jim can only be put square. And that he shall be! What's the use of my
hoarding in my old stocking; it'll never be any good to me; and so I may as well
have the pleasure of helping somebody else. Scadgers, that was the name; I'll
get that put right at once. Scadgers! I wonder where he lives. However, that'll
be easily found out. Poor Jim! what a good husband he'll make that rosy-faced
girl!&quot;</p>
<p>What was it that made Kate Mellon's head drop on her hands, and the tears
ooze through the fingers covering her eyes? Not the thought of Mr. Prescott's
marrying some one else surely, for had she not resolutely snubbed his proposals?
Certain it is that she remained with her head bowed for full ten minutes, and
that when she looked up, her face was tear-dabbled and her eyes red and swollen.
She took no heed of her appearance, however, but walked into the house, and
pulling out her gaudy blotting-book, she scrawled a long letter, which, when
finished, she addressed to &quot;E. Churchill, Esq., <i>Statesman</i> Office, E.C.&quot;</p>

<h5>TIGHTENING THE CURB.</h5>
<br>
<p>The garden-party at Uplands had a serious effect on the household in Great
Adullam Street. Of course the actual disturbance, the state of warfare
engendered by what Frank Churchill imagined he had seen take place between his
wife and Captain Lyster in the shrubbery, did not last long. When Barbara swept
up to her bedroom from the hired brougham, Frank retreated into his little
snuggery and lit his old meerschaum-pipe, and sat gazing vacantly through the
smoke-wreaths, and pondering on the occurrences of the day. He could scarcely
realise to himself what had passed; he could scarcely imagine that the woman to
whom, twelve months since, he had sworn fealty, whose lightest whisper caused
his pulse to throb, and who, on her part, had changed the whole style and
current of her life for the sake of fulfilling her determination to be his and
his alone, could have so far repented of that great crisis in her career as to
listen to the compliments of another man, to receive, with evident satisfaction,
his unqualified admiration, and to fly off in a rage, with fire in her eyes and
bitter words on her lips, when her husband remonstrated with her on her conduct.
Here were they, that &quot;twain one flesh,&quot; that mysterious two-in-oner sitting
under the same roof indeed, but in separate rooms; each thinking hard thoughts
of the other, each with anger rife against the other, and with harsh words
applied to each other yet ringing in their ears. Great Heavens! thought Frank,
was this what he had fondly pictured to himself? Was this the quiet haven of
repose, the lodge in the vast wilderness of Mesopotamia, with one fair spirit
for his minister, on which he had so rashly reckoned? Was the lodge to be a
divided territory? and was the fair spirit to be equally fair to some other man,
and to be a minister of the blatant, reviling, Boanerges class? Instead of the
quiet and rest on which he had calculated, and which were so necessary to him
after his exciting hard work, was his mind to be racked by petty jealousies, his
peace invaded by wretched squabbles, the sunshine of his existence overclouded
with gloom and doubt? Was his wife to be an adversary instead of a helpmate?
were her-- And then abruptly he stopped in his self-torturing, as he thought of
her,--how friendless and unprotected she was, how he alone was her prop and stay
in the world; and then he turned the whole matter in his mind, and it occurred
to him that that horribly irritable temper of his might have led him again into
mischief, causing him to see things that really might not have happened, and to
use language far stronger than there was any necessity for, and to render him
violent and undignified and absurd, and so completely to do away with the force
accruing from his right position. For undoubtedly he was in the right position;
for had he not seen with his own eyes--what? They were walking together,
certainly; but there was no reason why that should not be: fifty other couples
were promenading the same grounds at the same time, and--no! on reflection, he
did not see Lyster kiss her hand; it was that young idiot who was gabbling to
him the whole time, and who said something about it. Perhaps nothing of the kind
had occurred. Barbara had denied it instantly; and when had she ever breathed a
falsehood to him? She was not the style of woman to equivocate; her pride would
save her from that; and--it must have been all fancy! some horrible mistake, out
of which had arisen this wretched scene and his worse than wretched rage. And
now there was something between them, some horrible misunderstanding which must
be at once set right. If--if any thing were to happen to either of them, and one
were to die while there was enmity, or something like it, existing between them!
and this thought caused the meerschaum to be laid aside unfinished, and sent
Frank striding up, four stairs at a time, to his bedroom.</p>
<p>He found Barbara sitting in her white dressing-gown, arranging her hair
before the looking-glass. Her face was very white, her eyelids a little red and
puffed, and her lips were tightly pressed together. She took no notice of the
opening of the door, but went calmly on with her toilet. Frank was a little
disconcerted by this; he had calculated on a tender look of recognition, a few
smothered words of explanation, and a final tableau in each other's arms. But as
Barbara, with the greatest serenity, still appeared completely immersed in the
intricate plaiting evolutions she was performing with a piece of her hair and a
stalwart hair-pin, Frank advanced gently, and standing behind her chair, touched
her shoulder, and said softly, &quot;Darling!&quot;</p>
<p>There was no reply; but the hands occupied in the plaiting manoeuvre perhaps
shook a little.</p>
<p>&quot;My darling,&quot; repeated Frank, &quot;won't you notice me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Were you speaking to me?&quot; asked Barbara in an icy voice, and looking up at
him with a calm rigid blank face.</p>
<p>&quot;To whom else should I be speaking? to whom else should I apply that term?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Really I can't say. The last time you spoke to me, you were good enough to
swear; and as I know you pride yourself on your consistency, I could not imagine
you could so soon alter your tone.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No; but, Barbara dearest, you should not throw that in my teeth; you know
that I was vexed; that I--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Vexed, Frank! Vexed! I wonder at you! You accuse me of something utterly
untrue, in language such as I have never listened to before; and then, as an
excuse, you plead that you were vexed!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was foolish, Barbara, headstrong and horrible, and let my confounded
temper get the mastery over me; but then, child, you ought to forgive me; for
all I did was from excess of love for you. If I did not hang upon every word,
every action, of yours, I should be far less exacting in my affection. You
should think of that, Barbara.&quot;</p>
<p>His voice was broken as he spoke, and she noticed that the hand which was
upon her chair-back shook palpably.</p>
<p>&quot;You <i>could</i> not have meant what you said in the brougham, Frank,&quot; said
she in a softened tone. &quot;You could not have imagined that I should have
permitted--there, I cannot speak of it!&quot; she exclaimed abruptly, placing her
handkerchief to her swimming eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;No, my darling, I will not. I could not--I never--of course--fool that I
am!&quot; and then incoherently, but satisfactorily, the question was dismissed.</p>
<p>Dismissed temporarily, but by no means forgotten, by no means laid aside by
either of them. Captain Lyster called the next day while Frank was at the
office, eager to see whether Mrs. Churchill had repented of the task she had
undertaken in counselling and warning Alice Schröder; and Barbara told her
husband on his return of the visit she had had, and mentioned it with eyes which
a desire not to look conscious rendered somewhat defiant, and with cheeks which
flushed simply because it was the last thing they ought to have done. Heaven
knows Barbara Churchill had nothing to be ashamed of in being visited by Captain
Lyster. She never had the smallest sign of a feeling stronger than friendship
for him, and yet she felt somewhat guilty, as she acknowledged to herself that
his visit had given her very great pleasure. The truth was that the garden-party
at Uplands had completely upset the current of Barbara's life. When, in the
first wild passion of her love for him who became her husband, she had willingly
forfeited all that had hitherto been the pleasure of her life,--the luxury and
admiration in which she had been reared, the pleasant surroundings which had
been hers since her cradle,--she had found something in exchange. She had given
up half-a-hundred friendships, which she knew to be hollow and empty; but she
had consoled herself with one vast love, which she believed to be lasting and
true, and which, after all, was a novelty.</p>
<p>As has been said, Barbara had had her flirtations innumerable, but she had
never known before what love was; and having a very sensitive organisation, and
going in heart and soul for the new passion, she had not in any great degree, at
all events felt the alteration in her position. Although every thing was
different and inferior, every thing was in some degree connected with him, who
was paramount in her idea to any thing she had ever known. She might feel the
dulness of the neighbourhood, the smallness of the house, the difference in the
society and in her own occupations and amusements; but all these were part and
parcel of that sun of her existence--her husband; that great luminary, in whose
brilliant rays all little gloom-spots were swallowed up and merged. Even when
the glamour died away, and the blacknesses stood out in bold relief, she had
been so dazed by the brightness, and, owing to the thorough change, the events
of her past life seemed so far away, as to awaken but very little remorse or
regret. She was beginning to bear with something like patience the prosiness of
her mother-in-law, the spiteful criticisms of Mrs. Harding, the hideous
vulgarity of some of her other neighbours. But the visit to Uplands came upon
her as a terrific shock. Once more mixing in her old society, hearing the
fashionable jargon to which she had been accustomed from her youth up; meeting
those who had always looked up to her as their superior in beauty, and
consequently in marketable value; listening to soft compliments; seeing her
wishes, ever so slightly hinted, obeyed with alacrity; breathing once more that
atmosphere in which she was reared, but from which she seemed to have been long
estranged,--Barbara felt more and more like Barbara Lexden, while Barbara
Churchill faded hazily away. The dull, dull street,--the dead, dead life,--the
poverty which prescribed constant care in the household management,--the dowdy
dresses and second-hand manners of the inhabitants of the quarter,--the daily
vexations and cares and wrong-way rubbings, seemed all to belong to some hideous
dream, while the real existence passed into the former life with a pleasant
addition in the person of Frank. The pleasure was brief enough, and she woke to
all the horrors rendered doubly bitter by the short renewal of bygone joys. The
clock had struck twelve, the ballroom had vanished, and she was again Cinderella
with haunting memory for her glass-slipper. The prince remained, certainly; but
he was no longer a prince; he had bad tempers, and was peevish and jealous, and
thoroughly mortal. She had returned to the dust and dreariness of Great Adullam
Street, and the rattling cabs, and Mrs. Churchill in her old black-silk dress,
and the Hebrews opposite smoking their cigars at the open windows in the hot
summer evenings. She could scarcely fancy that there was a world where people
dressed in full muslin, and pink-crape bonnets, or bewitching hats; where
business was unknown, and work never heard of; where there were perpetual
croquet-parties and picnics and horticultural fêtes; where there were
night-drives homeward in open carriages after Richmond dinners; and where the
men talked of something else than when Brown was going to bring out his poems,
or what a slating Smith's novel had had in the <i>Scourge</i>. In that brief
respite from her weary life, she had heard those around her talking of their
plans to be carried out on the then occurring break-up of the season; she had
heard girls talk with rapture of their approaching visits to German Spas and
Italian lakes; she had heard arrangements made for meeting in English
country-houses, where she had formerly been an eagerly sought-for guest; or at
fashionable seaboards, where she had been the reigning belle. And she came back
with the full knowledge that a fortnight's run to some cockney watering-place,
handy of access to London, where she could live in cheap lodgings and play, a
very undistinguished part, would be all the relaxation she could possibly hope
for. And all this sunk into her soul, and made her wretched and discontented,
and formed the wandering isles of night which dashed the very source and fount
of her day.</p>
<p>It was wrong, undoubtedly. She had chosen her course, and must run it; as the
Mesopotamians would have expressed themselves, she had made her bed, and must
lie upon it. She had her husband to think of, and should have struggled
womanfully to bear up against all these small crosses and disquietudes for his
sake; she should have met her fate with a brave heart, and striven to prevent
his having any suspicion of the longings and disappointments by which she was
racked. Barbara should have done all this, as we in our different way should
have done so much, which we have resolutely omitted,--paid that bill, for
instance; avoided that woman; not bought that horse; helped that old friend;
denied ourselves that fling in print at Jones. She should have done; but, like
us, she didn't. Her character was any thing but perfect; and the very pride on
which she so much prided herself, and which should have left her straight, now
turned against herself, and, &quot;like a hedgehog rolled the wrong way,&quot; pricked her
mercilessly. She did indeed struggle to contend with the feelings which were
conquering her, and which were the &quot;little low&quot; sensations renewed with tenfold
force; but without success. A dead dull despair, a loathing and detestation of
all the circumstances of her life, a horror of the people round her, and a wild
regret for what had gone before never to return,--these were the demons which
beset Barbara's daily path. And with them at one time came the first
threatenings of another feeling which would have been more destructive to all
chance of present or future happiness than any other, had not Providence in its
mercy counteracted its effect by a passion, bad indeed, torturing, and hurtful,
but nothing like so deadly as the other. Weighed down by her real or fancied
misery, constantly repining in secret, and comparing her present with her past
life, Barbara might have been tempted to think of Frank as the agent of her
wretchedness, as the primary mover in the chain of events which had made her
exchange Tyburnia for Great Adullam Street, luxury for comparative poverty, and
happiness for despair; she might have done this, but she became jealous. She
noticed that lately Frank's manner had been strange and preoccupied; that he was
away from home very much more frequently than when they were first married; that
from what she gathered when she heard him talking with his friends, he evidently
sought work which took him out, and on two or three occasions had gone on
country trips in the interest of the journal--duty which did not fall to his
lot, and which he had never undertaken before. His manner to her, she thought,
was certainly very much changed, and she did not like the alteration. He was
courteous always, and gentle; but he had gradually lost all that petting
fondness which, from its very rarity in a man of his stamp, was so winning at
first; and with his courtesy was mingled a grave sad air, which Barbara
understood to mean reproach, and which galled her mightily. I do not know that
Barbara at first really felt jealous of her husband: had she examined the
foundation of her jealousy and sifted its causes, there is very little doubt
that the natural sense which she undoubtedly possessed would have shown her that
her suspicions were absurd. But the truth is, she all unwittingly rather
encouraged the passion, as a relief from the monotonous misery of her life,
without a thought of how rapidly it grew, or what proportions it might
eventually assume. It was a change to think differently of Frank, to take a
feverish interest in his proceedings and in the proceedings of those with whom
he was brought into contact; and Frank himself was surprised to find how the
&quot;little low&quot; fits had been succeeded by a more sprightly demeanour--a demeanour
which showed itself in sharp glances and bitter words.</p>
<p>And Frank, was he happy? In truth, not one whit happier than his wife, though
his wretchedness sprang from a different cause and was shown in a different way.
He felt that he had clutched the great prize, and found it to be a Dead-Sea
apple; that he had reached the turning-point of his career, passed it, and found
the rest of his course all down-hill; he had played the great stake of his life
and lost it; and henceforward his heart's purse was empty, and he was bankrupt
in affections. It had come upon him, gradually indeed, but with overwhelming
force: at first he had ascribed Barbara's pettishness to the mere vagaries of a
girl, and had looked upon her caprices as relics of that empire which had been
hers so long, and from which she, naturally enough, was unwilling to part. He
had seen, not without annoyance, indeed, but still without any deep or lasting
pang, that there was an uncomfortable feeling, based either upon rivalry or some
other passion equally unintelligible to him, between his wife and his mother;
but he had hoped this would pass away. He had noticed that his old friends,
though they spoke with warm admiration of Barbara's beauty, deemed to shirk any
question of liking or being pleased with her; and that, let them meet her
however often, she scarcely seemed to make any progress in their regard; but he
thought this was as much their fault as hers, and that the estrangement would
wear off. It was not until his mother had dropped her hint as to the frequency
of Captain Lyster's visits, that Frank's mind began to be seriously disturbed;
it was not until the scene at Uplands, of which he had been an unwilling
spectator, and the subsequent scene with Barbara in the brougham, that he began
to feel that his marriage had been a horrible mistake. Then all Barbara's &quot;low&quot;
fits, all her silence, all the tears which he could see constantly welling up
into her eyes, and kept back only by a struggle as palpable as the tears
themselves; then the complaints of dulness and monotony--all poor Barbara's
shortcomings, indeed, and they were not a few--were ascribed to one source. She
had known this man in former days; he was of her society and set, and had
probably made love to her, as had hundreds before; and Frank ground his teeth as
he thought how Barbara's reputation as a flirt, and her attractive qualities as
a coquette, had been kindly mentioned to him by more than one of her old
friends. Some quarrel had probably occurred between them; during which he Frank
had crossed her path, had fallen at her feet,--dazed idiot that he was!--and she
had raised him up, and out of pique had married him. That was the story, Frank
could swear to it! he turned it over and over in his mind until he believed it
implicitly, and conjured up the different scenes and passages, which made his
blood boil and sent him, with set teeth and scowling brow, stamping through the
long-echoing Mesopotamian squares, to the intense wonder of the policeman and
the few passers-by in those dreary thoroughfares. Only when he was quite alone,
however, did he in the least give way to his emotions. When he was at
home--where he and Barbara would now sit for hours without exchanging a word,
and where the occasional presence of a third person rendered matters more
horrible, compelling them to put on a ghastly semblance of affectionate
familiarity--when he was at home, or down at the <i>Statesman</i> Office, where
he could be thoroughly natural, he was moody, stern, and silent. His manner had
lost that round jollity which had always characterised it, and his appearance
was beginning to change: he was thinner; there were silver lines in the brown
hair, and two or three deep lines round the eyes.</p>
<p>Of course his friends noticed all this, as friends notice every thing. Madly
and blindly people go through life, imagining that their thoughts and actions
are--some of them, at least--known but to themselves alone; whereas all of
them--all such, at least, as they would prefer keeping secret--are public
property, and as thoroughly patent as if they had been proclaimed from the
market-place cross. You may go on in London living for years next door to a
neighbour whose name you are unacquainted with, and whom you have never seen;
but make him an acquaintance, give him some interest in you, and without your in
the least suspecting it, he will find out the whole story of your life, will
know all about the young lady with the fair hair in Wiltshire, the hundred
pounds borrowed from Robinson, the disappointment at Uncle Prendergast's
will--all the little things, in fact, which you thought were buried in your own
bosom; and will sit down opposite you at table with an innocent ingenuous face,
as though your affairs were the very last things with which he would trouble
himself. We all do this, day by day, with the noblest hypocrisy, and receive
from our dear intimate statements of facts which we know to be false, and
warpings of statements which we know to be perverted, with &quot;Indeeds!&quot; and
&quot;Reallys?&quot; and head-noddings of outward acquiescence and mocking incredulity in
our hearts. Barbara Churchill had been the one grand subject of conversation for
the Mesopotamian gossips ever since her marriage: they had lived upon her, and
found that she improved in flavour. Her appearance, her dress, her manners; what
they were pleased to term her &quot;stand-offishness;&quot; her shortcomings as a
housekeeper; her ignorance in the matter of mending under-linen; her
novel-reading and piano-playing--all these had been toothsome morsels, far more
enjoyable than the heavy pies, the thick chops, and the sardines which figured
in that horrible Mesopotamian meal known as &quot;a thick tea;&quot; and had been picked
to the very bone. And then, when it began to be whispered about--as it very soon
did--that there were dissensions in the Churchill camp, that all did not go as
smoothly as it should, and that, in fact, quarrels were rife--then came the
crowning delight of the banquet, and the female portion of the
Great-Adullam-Street community was nearly delirious with excitement. Although
old Mrs. Churchill, from her kind-heartedness and simplicity, had always been a
great favourite with her neighbours, she had no idea of the extent of her
popularity until this period. Her little rooms were literally beset with female
friends; and she had invitations to tea-parties three-deep. To these
invitations--to as many of them, at least, as was possible--she invariably
responded. By nature the old lady hated the character of a gossip, and would
have been highly indignant had she been charged with any propensity for
chattering; but easily impressible by those with whom she was brought into
contact, she had acquired a little of the prevalent failing of the region, and
moreover, she thought it her duty to tell all she knew about the then favourite
subject, in order, as she phrased it, &quot;that poor Frank's position might be set
right.&quot; But if poor Frank's position was properly looked after, it must be
acknowledged that poor Barbara received her meed of popular disapprobation. Not
that her mother-in-law ever said one direct word of condemnation; old Mrs.
Churchill was far too good a Christian willingly to start or give currency to
harsh criticism, more especially on one so closely allied to her. But, it was
very difficult to absolve her son from blame without shifting the onus of the
avowed quarrel on to the shoulders of her daughter-in-law; and when the ladies
surrounding the tea-table, groaning over &quot;poor Mr. Churchill's&quot; domestic woes,
shook their cap-strings in virtuous indignation at her who had caused them, the
old lady made but a feeble protest, which speedily closed in a string of doleful
ejaculations. In the minds of the members of this Mesopotamian Vehmgericht, of
which Mrs. Harding might be considered president, Barbara stood fully convicted
of the charge which they had themselves brought against her. Her indolence, her
carelessness, her &quot;fal-lal ways,&quot; her pride and squeamishness had brought--only
rather sooner than was expected--their natural result; and &quot;isn't it better, my
dear, to have a little less good looks and a little less fondness for jingling
the piano and reading trashy novels, and keep a tidy house over your head and
live happily with your husband?&quot;</p>
<p>The stories of all that passed in Churchill's house, collected with care from
old Mrs. Churchill and her servant Lucy,--whose habitual puritanical taciturnity
was melted by the course of events, and who gave way to that hatred against
Barbara which she had felt from the first moment of seeing her,--and duly
dressed, illustrated, and annotated by Mrs. Harding, who had a special talent in
that way, of course before long reached Mr. Harding's ears.</p>
<p>It is difficult to explain how that good fellow was affected by the news. He
had the warmest personal regard for Frank, loving him with something of paternal
fondness; he had always impressed him with the propriety of marriage, and had
looked forward with real anxiety to the time when he should see his friend
settled for life. Not until then, he thought, would those talents which he knew
Frank possessed enable him to take his proper position in the world: what he did
now was well enough; but it was merely the evanescent sparkle of his genius.
Soberly settled down with a woman worthy of him, the real products of his
intellect and his reading would come forth, and he would step into the first
rank of the men of his time. And now it had all come to this! Frank was married;
but he had made a wrong selection, and was a moody, discontented, blighted man.
The aspect of affairs was horrible; and when told of their real condition by his
wife, George Harding determined that he would exercise his prerogative of
friend, and speak to Churchill on the subject.</p>
<p>Accordingly the next day when he saw Frank at the usual consultation at the
office, Harding waited until the other man had left the room, and then, placing
his hand affectionately on his friend's shoulder, said: &quot;I want two minutes with
you, Frank.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Two hours, if you like, Harding; it's all the same to me,&quot; replied Churchill
wearily.</p>
<p>&quot;I want you to tell me what ails you,--what has worked such a complete change
in you, physically and morally; or rather, I don't want you to tell me, for I
know.&quot;</p>
<p>Churchill looked up defiantly with flushed cheeks, as he exclaimed, &quot;What do
you know? are my private affairs topics for the tittle-tattle of--there, God
help me! I'm weak as water. Now I want to quarrel with my best friend!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, you don't, old man; and you would get no quarrel out of me, if you
wished it ever so much. But I can't bear this any longer; I can't bear to see
you losing your health and your spirits; and wearing yourself out day by day as
you are, without coming to the rescue. Let us look the matter boldly in the face
at once. You're--you're not quite happy at home, Frank, eh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Happy!&quot; he echoed, with a strange hollow laugh; &quot;no, not entirely perhaps.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, that's a bad thing; but it's curable. At all events, giving way to
moping and misery won't help it. Many men have begun their married life in
wretchedness, and emerged, when they least expected it, into sunshine. Here are
two young people who have not known each other above a couple of months, both of
whom have very possibly been spoiled beforehand, and they arrive each with their
own particular stock of whims and fancies, which they declare shall be carried
out by the other. It takes time to rub down all the angles and points, and to
provide for the regular working of the machinery; and it is never done by a
jump. You've fine material to work upon too; if Mrs. Churchill were vulgar or
uneducated, or did not care for you, you would have great difficulties to
contend with. But as she is exactly the reverse of all this, she ought to be
easily managed. Don't you understand that in these matters one or the other must
have the upperhand? and that one should be the husband! The supremacy once
asserted, all works well; not until then, and generally the struggle, though
sharp, is very short. Every thing is wrong, and the whole machine is out of
gear. You've let her have her own way too much, my friend. You must tighten the
curb and see the result.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you were a horseman, Harding,&quot; said Frank with a dreary smile, &quot;you would
know that tightening the curb sometimes produces the worst of rebellious
vices--rearing!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, no fear of that; no fear of that. Try it! You really must do something,
Frank; I can't bear to see you giving way like this. You must assert yourself,
my good fellow, and at once; for though it may be bad now, it will be ten times
worse hereafter, and you'll bitterly rue not having taken my advice.&quot;</p>
<p>And George Harding went home and told, his wife what he had done, and assured
her that she would find matters speedily set to rights in Great Adullam Street
now.</p>
<p>And Frank Churchill walked home, pondering on the advice he had just received
and finally determining within himself to adopt it. He supposed he had been weak
and wanting in proper self-respect. Harding was always the reflex of his wife's
sentiments, and doubtless that whole set of wretched tabbies had been pitying
him as a poor spiritless creature. He would take Harding's advice and bring the
matter to an issue at once.</p>
<p>He went into his little study and had just seated himself at his desk to
commence his work when Barbara entered the room. She was dressed in her bonnet
and shawl; her eyes were swollen and there were traces of recent tears still on
her cheeks; the muscles round her mouth were working visibly, and her whole
frame was quivering with excitement. As she closed the door behind her, she
seemed to control herself with one great effort, then walking straight to the
desk she said, in a broken and trembling voice, &quot;I want you to answer me a
question.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Barbara!&quot; said Frank, whose intended firmness had all melted away before her
haggard appearance, &quot;Barbara!&quot; and he rose and put out his hand to draw her to
him.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't touch me!&quot; she screamed, starting back. &quot;Don't lay one finger upon me
until until you have answered my question. This morning you left this envelope
on the dressing-table; tell me who is the writer and what were the contents.&quot;</p>
<p>She tossed an envelope on to the desk as she spoke, and leant with one hand
against the wall.</p>
<p>&quot;That envelope,&quot; said Frank, speaking very slowly, &quot;is mine. I utterly deny
your right to ask me any thing about it; I utterly refuse to satisfy your
curiosity.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Curiosity! it is not that; God knows it is not that feeling merely that
prompts me: This is the second time you have, to my knowledge, received letters
in that writing. The first time was at Bissett, when you left suddenly,
immediately after its receipt. I suspected then, but had no right to ask; now I
have the right, and I demand to know!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can only repeat what I said before: I most positively decline to tell
you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Beware, Frank! You ought to know me by this time; but you don't. If you
don't satisfy me on this point, I leave you for ever.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You have your answer,&quot; said Frank; &quot;now let me get to my work.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You still refuse?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You heard what I said.&quot;</p>
<p>She drew herself up and left the room; the next minute he heard the
street-door shut, and, running to the dining-room window, saw her hail a cab and
get into it.</p>
<p>&quot;There's the first lesson, at all events,&quot; said he to himself. &quot;When she
comes back to dinner, she will be cooler, and more amenable to reason.&quot;</p>
<p>He finished his work, and walked down with it to the <i>Statesman</i> Office.
On his return he found a commissionaire in the hall talking to his servant. He
asked the latter where her mistress was, but the girl said she had not come in,
at the same time handing him a letter. It was very brief; it merely said:</p>
<p>&quot;You have decided; and henceforth you and I never meet again. Mrs. Schröder,
with whom I am staying, will send her maid for a box which I have left ready
packed. I hope you may be more happy with your correspondent, and in your return
to your old life, than you have been with B. C.&quot;</p>
<p>As Frank Churchill read this, the lines wavered before his eyes, and he
reeled against the wall.</p>

<h5>MR. SCADGERS PAYS A VISIT.</h5>
<br>
<p>Those who had been most intimately acquainted with Mr. Scadgers of Newman
Street had never known him under any circumstances devote a portion of his
valuable time to sacrificing to the Graces. He was popularly supposed to sleep
in his clothes; and as those garments were seldom entirely free from fluff or
&quot;flue,&quot; there were probably some grounds for the supposition; but he could not
have slept in his big high-boots, though no one had ever seen him without them,
save Jinks. Jinks had more than once seen his master with slippered feet, and
trembled; for Mr. Scadgers' boots were to him what those other
Ingoldsby-celebrated boots were to the Baron Ralph de Shurland, what his hair
was to Samson, what his high-heels were to Louis Quatorze. Without his boots,
Mr. Scadgers was quite a different man; he talked of &quot;giving time,&quot; of &quot;waiting
a day or two,&quot; of &quot;holding-off a bit;&quot; this was in his slippers: but when once
his boots were on, in speaking of the same debtor he told Jinks to &quot;sell him up
slick, and clear off all his sticks.&quot; He always seemed to wear the same suit of
black, and all the washing that he was ever known to indulge in was by smearing
himself with the damp corner of a towel, which he kept in the office between the
chemist's bottles, one of which held the water; while his toilette was completed
by running a pocket-comb through his close-cropped hair, and then smoothing it
down with the palms of his hands, whisking his boots with his red-silk
pocket-handkerchief, and putting sharp spiky points to his nails by the aid of a
vicious-looking buck-handled penknife.</p>
<p>Thoroughly accustomed to his patron's appearance, Jinks was, then, struck
with wonderment on beholding him one morning enter the office in comparatively
gorgeous array. Through the folds of a white waistcoat there protruded a large
shirt-frill, certainly of rather a yellow hue, and not so neat in the plaits as
it ought to have been, but for all that an undeniable frill, such as adorned the
breasts of the dandies of the last generation; his usual napless greasy hat had
been discarded for a very elegant article in white beaver, which had apparently
been the property of some other gentleman, and acquired by its present owner in
that species of commercial transaction known as a &quot;swop,&quot; as it was much too
large for Mr. Scadgers, and obliterated every sign of his hair, while a corner
of the red-silk pocket-handkerchief fell out gracefully over the back of his
head. In his hand Mr. Scadgers carried one damp black-beaver glove, and a thick
stick like an elongated ruler, with a silver top and a silk tassel. Mr. Jinks
was so overpowered at this apparition that he sat gazing with open mouth at his
master, unable to speak a word; he had one comfort, however,--Mr. Scadgers had
his boots on, so that under all this frivolity there lurked an intention of
stern business.</p>
<p>Mr. Scadgers took no notice of his subordinate's astonishment; but placing
the glove and the stick on his desk, taking off the white hat, and having a
thorough mopping with the red-silk pocket-handkerchief, looked through his
letters, and proceeded to indorse them, for Jinks to answer, in his usual
business way. Some of his correspondence amused him, for he smiled and shook his
head at the letter in a waggish way, as though the writer were chaffing him; in
glancing over another he would lay his finger alongside his nose and mutter,
&quot;No, no, my boy! not by no means, no how!&quot; while at others his larger eye would
gleam ferociously, the upper corner of his mouth would twist higher than ever,
and he would shake his fist at the paper and utter words not pleasant to hear.
His mental emotions did not, however, interfere with his business habits: as he
finished each letter he wrote the substance of his reply on the back for Jinks
to copy, drew three or four cheques, which he also handed over to his factotum,
and locked away some flimsy documents which had formed the contents of certain
of the letters, in his cash-box. Some of the letters received by that morning's
post had contained bank-notes, and these Mr. Scadgers examined most scrupulously
before putting them away, holding them between his eyes and the light to examine
the water-mark, carefully scrutinising the engraving, and finally comparing the
numbers, dates, and ciphers, with the list contained in a printed bill pasted
against the inside of his desk-lid headed &quot;Stolen.&quot; Over one of the notes, after
comparing it with this list, Mr. Scadgers chuckled vastly.</p>
<p>&quot;90275 LB January 12! there you are correct to a T. I thought they'd turn up
about this time. I say, Jinks, here's one of the notes as was stolen from
Robarts's; you recollect? Come up from Doncaster in renewal-fee from Honourable
Capting Maitland. He took it over the Leger, no doubt: they always thought at
Scotland Yard that that was the way those notes would get put off; and they was
right. Send this back to the capting, Jinks,--he's gone back to Leeds barracks
now,--and tell him all about it; we can't have that, you know; might get us into
trouble; and if he wants a renewal, he must send another. He won't know where he
got it from, bless you! reg'lar careless cove as ever was; he ain't due till
Friday, and he's sent up to-day in a reg'lar fright. You must step round to
Moss's and tell 'em to proceed in Hetherington's matter. There's a letter there
from Sir Mordaunt, askin' for more time, and promisin' all sorts of things; but
I'm sick of him and his blather. Tell Moss to put the screw on, and he'll pay up
fast enough. Write a line to young Sewell, and tell him he can have 125<i>l</i>.,
and the rest in madeiry. He's in Scotland; you'll find his address in the
book,--Killy-something; say the wine can be sent to the Albany; but I won't do
it in any other way. Any one been in this morning?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Only Sharp, from Parkinson's,&quot; said Mr. Jinks, who was already deep in
letter-writing.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said his principal, &quot;what did he want?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He came to know if you'd be in another two hundred for Mr. Beresford,&quot;
replied Jinks, looking up from his work. &quot;He's been hit at Doncaster, and wants
the money most immediate.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then he won't get it from me,&quot; said Mr. Scadgers; &quot;I won't have no more of
his paper, at no price. He's up to his neck already, is Mr. Beresford; and that
old aunt of his don't mean dying yet, from all I hear.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There's the bishop,&quot; suggested Jinks.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, blow the bishop! He might be bled on the square, but he'd turn precious
rusty if he thought it was stiff he was paying for. No, no; Master Beresford's
taking lodgings in Queer Street, I fancy; Parkinson holds more of his paper than
you think of, and if he wants to go deeper, he must go by himself; I won't be in
it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All right,&quot; said Jinks; &quot;I'll put a cross against his name in the books.
Rittman's boy looked in to see if his father could have two pounds till
Saturday. I told him to call again this afternoon.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Till Saturday,&quot; said Scadgers with a grin. &quot;You never see such a Saturday as
that'll be, Jinks. Poor devil! there's nothing but the carcass left there; and
he's worked well too, and brought us plenty of custom, though not of the best
sort. Let the boy have a sovereign when he comes, Jinks, and tell him if his
father don't pay, I'll put him in prison; not that he'll mind that one dump. Oh,
by the way, give me all the paper of young Prescott's that you've got by you.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Jinks opened a large iron safe let into the wall just behind his stool,
and from a drawer therein took out a bundle of tape-tied papers. From this he
selected four, and as he handed them over to his principal, said, &quot;Here they
are; two with Pringle, one with Compton, and one IOU.,--total, one seventy-five.
I was going to ask you what you intended to do about them. The young feller was
here yesterday wanting to see you, and looking regularly down upon his luck.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah,&quot; said Scadgers, &quot;there's something up about them--what, I don't know;
but I'm a-goin' on that business now. I shall be away for an hour or two,
Jinks.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You ain't a-goin' to get married, are you, Mr. Scadgers?&quot; asked the little
old man with a look of alarm; &quot;it would never do to bring a female into the
concern.&quot;</p>
<p>Scadgers laughed outright. &quot;Married! no, you old fool, not I. Can't a man put
on a bit of finery&quot;--here be smoothed the yellow shirt-frill with his grimy
fingers--&quot;without your supposing there's a woman in the case? However, I'm goin'
to call upon a lady, and that's the truth; but all in a matter of business. Hand
over them bills of Prescott's, and don't expect me till you see me.&quot;</p>
<p>So saying, Mr. Scadgers took the bills from Jinks and placed them in his fat
pocketbook, which he buttoned into the breast-pocket of his frock-coat, gave
himself a good mopping with the red-silk pocket-handkerchief before throwing it
into the big white hat, and placing that elegant article on his head, took up
the one damp glove and the ruler-like stick, and went out.</p>
<p>A consciousness of the shirt-frill, or the hat, or both, pervaded Mr.
Scadgers' mind as he walked through the streets; and gave him an air very
different from that which usually characterised his business perambulations. He
seemed to feel that he was calling upon the passers-by for observation and
notice; and certainly the passers-by seemed to respond to the appeal. Ribald
boys stuck the red-covered books of domestic household expenditure which they
carried into their breasts, and swaggered by with heads erect; others openly
expressed their opinion that it was &quot;all dicky&quot; with him; while a more impudent
few suggested that he had stolen the &quot;guv'nor's tile,&quot; or borrowed his big
brother's hat; nor were the suggestions that he was a barber's clerk out for a
holiday wanting on the youthful populace. In an ordinary way Mr. Scadgers was
thoroughly proof against the most cutting chaff: the most terrific things had
been said about his boots, and he had remained adamant; drunken men had
requested permission to light their pipes at his nose, and he had never winced;
in allusion to his swivel-eye, boys had asked him to look round the corner and
tell them what o'clock it was, without ruffling his temper in the smallest
degree. But in the present instance he felt in an abnormal state; he knew that
there was ground for the satire which was being poured out upon him, and he fled
into the first omnibus for concealment. He rode to the utmost limits of the
omnibus-journey, and when he alighted he had still a couple of miles to walk to
his destination. He inquired his way and set out manfully. The weather was
magnificent; one of those early October days when, though the sun's rays are a
little tempered of their burning heat, and the air has a freshness which it has
not known for months, the country yet wears a summer aspect. Mr. Scadgers' way
lay along a high-road, on either side of which were fields: now huge yellow
patches shorn of their produce, and, while awaiting the ploughshare, looking
like the clean-shaved faces of elderly gentlemen; now broken up into rich loam
furrows driven through by the puffing snorting engine which has supplanted the
patient Dobbin, the handle-holding labourer, and whip-cracking boy of our
childhood, and against which Mr. Tennyson's Northern farmer inveighed with such
bitterness. Far away on the horizon lay a broad wooded belt, broken in the
centre, where two tall trees, twining their topmost branches together, formed a
kind of natural arch, and beyond which one expected--absurdly enough--to find
the sea. The road was quiet enough; a few carts, laden with farm-produce or
manure, crept lazily along it; now and then a carrier's wagon, drawn by a
heavily-trotting horse with bells on his collar, jolted by, or the trap of a
town-traveller returning from the home-circuit, driven by an ill-dressed
hobbledehoy with the traveller nodding by his side, and the black-leather apron
strapped over the back seat, to make the trap look as much like a phaeton as
possible, rattled townward. But when in obedience to the directions on a
finger-post, Mr. Scadgers turned out of the high-road up a long winding lane,
fringed on either side by high hedges, on which &quot;Autumn's fiery finger&quot; had been
laid only to increase their beauty a thousand-fold, where not a sound broke the
stillness save his own footfall and the occasional chirping of the birds, he
seemed for the first time to awake to the beauty of the scene. Climbing to the
top bar of a gate in the hedge on the top of a little eminence, he seated
himself, took off the big hat, mopped himself violently with the red-silk
handkerchief, and looked round on the panorama of meadow and woodland, with tiny
silver threads of water here and there interspersed, until his heart softened
and he had occasion to rub the silver head of the ruler-like stick into his
eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Lor' bless me!&quot; he muttered to himself; &quot;it's like Yorkshire, and yet
prettier than that; softer and quieter like. More than twenty years since I've
seen any thing like this. And poor Ann! Daisy-chains we used to make in
Fairlow's mead, just like that field there, when we was little children;
daisy-chains and buttercups, and--poor Ann! And to think what I'm now a-goin'
to--Lord help us! well, it <i>is</i> a rum world!&quot; with which sage though
incoherent reflections Mr. Scadgers resumed the big hat, dismounted from the
gate, and continued his walk.</p>
<p>As he proceeded up the lane, he began to take particular notice of the
objects by which he was more immediately surrounded; and on hearing the tramp of
hoofs he peered through the hedge, and saw strings of horses, each mounted by
its groom, at exercise. At these animals Mr. Scadgers looked with a by no means
uncritical eye, and seemed satisfied, for he muttered, &quot;Good cattle and plenty
of 'em too; looks like business that. Wise head she has; I knew it <i>would</i>
turn out all right.&quot; When he arrived at the lodge, he stopped in front of the
gates and looked scrutinisingly about him, then rang the bell, and stared hard
but pleasantly at the buxom woman who stood curtseying with the gate in her
hand. Inside, Mr. Scadgers noticed that every thing looked neat and prosperous;
he did not content himself with going straight up the carriage-drive, but
diverged across the lodge-keeper's garden, and peered into the little farmyard,
where the mastiff came out of his kennel to scan the stranger, and where two or
three helpers, lounging on the straw-ride, or polishing bits as they leant
against the stable-doors, mechanically knuckled their foreheads as he passed by.
Arriving at the house, Mr. Scadgers found the front-door open; but a pull at the
bell brought a staid, middle-aged woman (Kate Mellon, for it was The Den which
Mr. Scadgers was visiting, never could stand what she called &quot;flaunting
hussies,&quot; as servants), by whom he was ushered into the pretty little hall, hung
with its antlers, its foxes' brushes, and its sporting picture, and into the
dining-room. There he was left by himself to await the coming of the owner of
the house.</p>
<p>Now Mr. Scadgers, though by no means a nervous or impressible man, seemed on
this occasion to have lost his ordinary calm, and to be in a very excitable
state. He laid the big hat carefully on the table, refreshed himself with a
thorough mop with the red-silk handkerchief, and rubbed his hands through his
stubbly black hair; then he walked up and down the room, alternately sucking the
silver head of the ruler-like stick, and muttering incoherencies to himself, and
ever and anon he would stop short in his perambulations and glance at the door
with an air almost of fright. The door at length was opened with a bang, and
Kate Mellon entered the room. The skirt of her dress was looped up, and showed a
pair of red-striped stockings and large, though well-shaped, thick Balmoral
boots; she had a driving-whip in one hand and on the other a strong dogskin
gauntlet, stretched and stained. Her face was flushed, her eyes bright, and the
end of her hair was just escaping from the light knot into which it had been
bound. With a short nod to her visitor, at whose personal appearance she gave a
glance of astonishment, she began the conversation by asking what his pleasure
was.</p>
<p>If Mr. Scadgers' behaviour had been somewhat peculiar before her entrance, it
was now ten times more remarkable. At first he stood stock-still with his mouth
open, gazing at her with distended eyes; then he fell to nodding his head
violently and rubbing his hands as if thoroughly delighted, and then looked her
up and down as though he were mentally appraising each article of dress.</p>
<p>&quot;What's the man up to?&quot; said Kate, after undergoing a minute of this
inspection; &quot;come, none of this tomfoolery here. What do you want?&quot;</p>
<p>Recalled to himself by the sharp tone in which these words were uttered, Mr.
Scadgers fell into his usual state, bowed, and said he had called by
appointment.</p>
<p>&quot;By appointment?&quot; said. Kate; &quot;oh, ah, I recollect now. You overcharged me
for two horses and a dog in the list for last year. I filled up your form-thing
fairly enough; why didn't you go by that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Two horses and a dog!&quot; repeated Mr. Scadgers. &quot;There's some mistake, miss;
my name's Scadgers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Lord, that is a good 'un!&quot; said Kate, dropping the whip and clapping her
hands in an ecstasy of laughter. &quot;I thought you were the man about the taxes
that I've sent for to come to me, too. So your name's Scadgers, is it? I've
heard of you, sir; you get your living in a queer way.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pretty much the same as you and the rest of the world, I believe,&quot; said
Scadgers, pleasantly;--&quot;by the weakness of human natur'!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Which you take a pretty considerable advantage of, eh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I don't know: a gent wants money and he hears I've got it, and he
comes to me for it. I don't seek him,--he seeks me; I tell him what he'll have
to pay for it, and he agrees. He has the money, and he don't return it; and when
he goes through the Court and it all comes out, people cry, 'Oh, Scadgers again!
oh, the bloodsucker! here's iniquity!' and all the rest of the gammon. If people
wants luxuries, miss, they must pay for 'em, as you know well enough.&quot;</p>
<p>This was not said in the least offensively, but in a quiet earnest manner, as
though the man had real belief in what he stated, and saw no harm in the calling
he was defending. Kate, who had a pretty shrewd knowledge of character, saw this
at once, and felt more kindly disposed to her new acquaintance than she had at
first.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; she said, &quot;what's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander, they
say; and it's not my business to preach to you, and you wouldn't heed it it I
did. I got you to come here on business. You hold some acceptances of Mr. James
Prescott's?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's true, miss; I've got 'em here in my pocketbook.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What's the amount?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The total, one seventy-five; cab-hire and loss of time, say one seventy-five
ten six.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hand them over, and I'll write you a cheque.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Mr. Scadgers, slowly, &quot;we don't generally take cheques in these
matters,--it ain't business; they mightn't be paid, you know,--but I don't mind
doing it for you.&quot;</p>
<p>Something in the tone of this last sentence which struck oddly on Kate
Mellon's ear,--a soft tender tone of almost parental affection; a tone which
seemed to bring back memory of past days. She looked up hurriedly, but Mr.
Scadgers' swivel-eye was fixed on the wall above her head; and in the rest of
his countenance there was no more emotion visible than on the face of a Dutch
clock. Kate Mellon took out her desk and wrote the cheque.</p>
<p>&quot;There!&quot; she said, handing it to him,--&quot;there's your money; hand over the
bills. All right! Now, two things more. One, you'll swear never to let Mr.
Prescott know who paid this money. Good! The other, if ever he comes to you for
help again--I don't think he will, mind; but if he does--you'll refuse him, and
let me know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's what they all say,&quot; said Mr. Scadgers, &quot;if they come again, refuse
'em;' and they do come again, and I don't refuse 'em,--that is if I think
they're good for the money,--but I'll swear I'll do it for you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I believe you,&quot; said Kate, simply. &quot;Now, have some lunch before you go.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, thank you,&quot; said Scadgers, &quot;no lunch; but I should like a glass of wine
to drink your health in.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You shall have it, and welcome,&quot; said she, ringing the bell; &quot;and I'll have
one with you, for I was at the dumb-jockey business when you came in, and it
rather takes it out of one.&quot;</p>
<p>When the wine was brought, Kate filled two glasses, and, taking up one,
nodded to Mr. Scadgers. &quot;Here's luck,&quot; said she, shortly. Mr. Scadgers took his
glass, and said; &quot;The best of luck to you in every thing, and God bless you,
my--miss, I mean! And now, I've heard a lot about your stable and place--would
you mind my going round them, before I go?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mind!&quot; said Kate; &quot;I'll take you myself.&quot; And they walked into the farm
together.</p>
<br>
<p>&quot;It was as much as I could do,&quot; said Mr. Scadgers to himself, as, half an
hour afterwards, he walked down the lane on his way back to town--&quot;it was as
much as I could do to prevent throwing my arms round her neck and telling her
all about it. What a pretty creetur' it is; and what spirit! I suppose she's
nuts on young Prescott, and they'll be gettin' married. Lord! that would be a
rum start if he ever knew--but he won't know, nor any of 'em; we shall never let
on. Woman of business too; keeps accounts I noticed, when she opened her desk;
and all the place in such order; kept as neat as a drawing-room those stables.
Well, that's one thing you did right, John Scadgers, and one you won't be sorry
for some day.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's a queer customer,&quot; said Kate to herself, as she stood in the lane by
the lodge-gate, looking after his receding figure. &quot;A very queer customer. What
a grip he gave my hand when he said good-by! My fingers ache with it still. And
there was no nonsense about him; I could see that in a minute. Where have I seen
him before? I've some sort of recollection of him; but I can't fit it to any
thing particular--he's not in the horse-line, and he's not a swell; so I don't
see where I can have come across him. Glad he looked in this morning, for I was
precious dull: I can't make out what this weight is that's hanging over me for
the last few days, just as though something was going to happen. I think another
glass of Madeira would do me good; but I promised Simnel I'd knock that off. I
wonder what's come of Simnel for the last few days. That old Scadgers seemed to
know something about this place, noticed the alterations in the five-acre
meadow; and when I asked him, said he remembered the place when it was Myrtle
Farm. I must ask Simnel about him, he--Lord, how depressed and stupid I feel
again!&quot; She turned back and fastened the gate after her. One of the gatekeeper's
chubby children came running out to meet her, and she caught the little thing up
in her arms, and carried it into the lodge. As she was putting it down she heard
the tramp of horses' feet, and raising her head, looked through the window. The
next instant her cheeks flushed scarlet; she dropped the child into a chair, and
rushing to the gate, threw it open, and stood gazing down the road.</p>
<p>Yes, it was he! no mistaking his figure, even if she had, not recognised the
horse. It was he riding so close to the lady by his side, bending over her and
looking down, into her upturned face. So preoccupied that he never even bestowed
a glance upon the place so well known to him, so frequently visited in bygone
days. And she, who was she? Kate could see that she was slim, could see her fair
hair gathered in a knot beneath hat,--it must be the woman of whom Simnel had
spoken. And Kate Mellon gave a loud groan, and clenched her nails into the palms
of her hands, and stood looking after them with quivering lips and a face as
pale as death.</p>
<p>Just at that moment two grooms came riding round the corner, side by side.
The sound of their horses' feet recalled Kate to herself. She looked up, and in
one of them recognised Beresford's man. She collected herself by a great effort,
and beckoned to him. The man saw her, touched his hat, and rode up at once,
leaving his companion to proceed by himself.</p>
<p>&quot;William,&quot; said Kate, &quot;who's that lady riding with your master?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mrs. Schröder, miss; Saxe-Coburg Square. Mr. Schröder drives pair of
chestnuts, miss, in mail-pheayton, plain black harness. May have noticed 'em;
often in the Park, miss.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! No; I think not. Schröder,--Saxe-Coburg Square, you said?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, miss. Beg pardon, miss,&quot; added the man, who had himself been formerly
in Kate's service, and by whom, as by all of his fraternity, she was
adored,--&quot;beg pardon, miss; but nothing wrong, is there? You're looking uncommon
ill, miss.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Kate, with a ghastly smile. &quot;I'm all right, thank you, William.
Good-day: ride on!&quot; and William, touching his hat, clapped spurs to his horse,
and rode off.</p>
<br>
<p>That night the mail-cart was waiting outside the little village post-office
and the old woman was just huddling the letters into the bag, when a groom came
up at a hand-gallop, and dismounting, gave in a letter, saying,</p>
<p>&quot;Just in time, Mrs. Mallins, I think!&quot;</p>
<p>The old woman peered at him over her spectacles.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, it's you, Thomas, is it? Well, I'll take a letter from your mistress,
though I'm not bound to do it by the reg'lations. You're after time, Thomas.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know, Mrs. Mallins; but Miss Kate said 'twere most particular. And I were
to tell you so, and--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Air you comin' with that bag?&quot; growled the mail-cart driver, putting his
head into the shop.</p>
<p>&quot;All right, my man! all right!&quot; said the old lady, handing him the bag.
&quot;There it is. Thomas, you can tell your lady she was in time.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p>Half an hour afterwards Kate Mellon's servant looked into the dining-room.
There was no light, and she was about to withdraw, when she heard her mistress's
voice say, &quot;What is it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, nothing, ma'am; only Thomas says the letter was in time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very well,&quot; said Kate. Then, when the door was shut again, she muttered
between her clenched teeth: &quot;It's done now, and can't be undone! Now, Master
Charley, look out for yourself!&quot;</p>
<br>

<h4><a name="div1_30" href="#div1Ref_30">CHAPTER XXX.</a></h4>
<h5>AFTER THE STORM.</h5>
<br>
<p>As you sit in the bow-window of your comfortable lodging at your favourite
watering-place during your annual autumn holiday, your breakfast finished and
the <i>débris</i> removed, the newspaper rustling idly on your knees, and the
first and pleasantest pipe of the day between your lips, you look up and see the
aspect of affairs in the little street below very much changed from its normal
state. The pleasure-boats--the <i>Lively Nancy</i>, which sails so regularly at
eleven A.M. with a cargo of happy excursionists, and which arrives in port at
irregular intervals varying from one to three, laden with leaden-coloured men
and hopelessly-bedraggled fainting women; the <i>William and Ellen</i>, in which
you go out to catch codling and plaice; and all the other little craft usually
stationed on the beach--have been bodily removed, their owners and touters are
drinking rum and smoking shag-tobacco in evil-smelling little public-houses, and
their customers have no notion of putting them into requisition. The
bathing-machines,--those cumbrous vehicles in which you have so often made that
dread journey into the ocean, after being bidden to &quot;stand by&quot; while the horse
gives his first awful jerk and afterwards dashes you against the sides of your
travelling-prison, while you catch horribly-distorted glimpses of your wretched
countenance in the miserable little sixpenny looking-glass pendant from the
rusty nail and swinging here and there like a live thing convulsed,--the
bathing-machines have all been dragged from the spot where they ordinarily stand
like a row of hideous guardians of the coast, and have defiantly taken
possession of one side of the little main street. The place where the German
band subsidised by the town usually pours forth its perpetual iteration of the
&quot;Faust&quot; waltz is now covered with roaring plunging waves, thick brown walls of
water rearing their white crests a hundred yards off, as if in survey of their
ultimate goal, tearing madly onward, gathering in size and strength at every
stride, and at length discharging themselves with a thunder-crash in a blinding
avalanche of spray. These 'waves, this roaring seething mass of trembling turgid
water, is the great attraction to-day. In vain the monkey on the three-legged
table clashes his cymbals, or plies the ramrod of his gun with frantic energy;
in vain the good-looking Italian boy, his master, shows his gleaming teeth or
touches his hat to attract attention; in vain the Highlander blows discord into
his bagpipes until all the neighbouring dogs possessing musical ears are howling
in misery. Nobody cares for anything but the sea to-day; the little parade is
thronged with visitors all gazing seaward, all rapt in attention on the boiling
waters; at one point, where the waves dash in and sweep over the solid masonry,
boys rush in between the ebb and flow, returning happy if they have escaped,
happier if they have been soaked by the spray. People look out all round and
scan the horizon to see if there be any craft in sight, inspired with that
singular feeling which only Rochefoucauld has dared to define, the feeling which
sends crowds to watch Blondin's walk upon the high-rope, or the performances of
a lion-tamer,--the feeling which, in a lesser extent, originates the
sensation-loving element in us, and which is about the lowest in degraded human
nature. Far away, at the end of the worm-eaten sea-besoaked jetty, is a little
cluster of fishermen in dreadnaught and sou'-westers, patiently watching the
weather, which to them is no toy nor amusement, but that on which hang their
hopes of daily bread; and they will tell you if you ask them, that these big
breakers thundering on to the shore are the result of some great storm that has
taken place far away in the heart of the Atlantic; and that though the tempest
is probably over now, these creations of its fury, these evidences of its wrath,
will continue to roll and surge and foam for days to come.</p>
<p>So it was with the Adullam-Street household and its surroundings. The storm
that had swept through it had been short, sharp, and decisive; but the traces of
its wrecking power were visible long, long after it had past.</p>
<p>At first it seemed quite impossible for Frank Churchill to understand the
extent of the misery which had fallen upon him. However roseate might have been
the dreams, in which he had indulged, of the blisses of matrimony, he had lived
too long in the world not to know that few indeed were the couples whose lives
were not checkered by some occasional difference. These, he had been told,
generally occurred in the early portion of a matrimonial career, while the two
persons were each unaccustomed to the peculiarities of the other, and while
ignorance was, to a great extent, supported and backed up by obstinacy and
pride. The unwillingness of each to give way would eventually result in a clash,
whence would arise one of those domestic differences popularly known as &quot;tiffs,&quot;
in which the actors, though horribly wretched in themselves and disagreeable to
each other, were supremely ridiculous to the rest of the world, which either
affected to be blind or sympathising, and in either case was sniggering in its
sleeve at the absurdity of the scene. But these little sparring-matches were
usually of short duration; and though a constant repetition of them might have a
triturating effect upon the original foundation of love and constancy, yet
Churchill had noticed that long before such a fatal result occurred, the sharp
angles and points had generally become gradually rounded off and rubbed down,
and the machine had begun to work harmoniously and with regularity. At all
events no open scandal took place. That open scandal, if not an actual healer of
wounds, is a rare anodyne to impulsive spirits and hearts, thumping painfully
against the tightened chain which day by day, with corroding teeth, is eating
its way into their core. Exposure, publicity in the press, Mrs. Grundy--these
are the greatest enemies of the Divorce-Court lawyers; heavy though the list of
cases standing over for hearing may be, it would be fifty times heavier could
the proceedings be kept secret. Hundreds of couples now living together, hating
each other &quot;with the hate of hell;&quot; scowling, carping, badgering, wearing,
maddening, to desperation driving, from the hour they rise till the hour they
retire to rest and fall asleep,--the one cursing his life, the other feebly
bemoaning her fate, or openly defiant, &quot;each going their own way;&quot; a state of
being more horrible, loathsome, and pitiable even than the other,--would be
disunited, were it not for the public scandal. &quot;For the sake of the children,&quot;
for the scandal which would be entailed on their offspring, Mrs. Emilia will not
leave Mr. Iago; and so they continue to live together, while the children are
daily edified spectators of the manner in which their father treats their
mother, and listen to the constantly-renewed expression of Mrs. Emilia's wish in
reference to the possession of that whip with which to lash the rascal (their
father) naked through the world.</p>
<p>The exposure--the public scandal! To no one had these words more terror in
their sound than to Frank Churchill. All his life he had shrunk from every
chance of notoriety: had gloried in being able to work anonymously; not for the
sake of shirking any responsibility, not from the slightest doubt of the right
and truth and purity of whatever cause he might be advocating: but because, when
he had shot his bolt, and hit his mark, as he generally did, he could stand
calmly by and mark the result, without being deafened by empty pans or sickened
by false flattery. His horror of publicity had been extreme; he had invariably
refused all details of his history to contemporary biographers, and had never
been so deeply disgusted as when he saw some of his work tracked home to its
author by the gossipping correspondent of a provincial paper. It was good work,
too--work creditable to his brain and his heart; yet had it been penny-a-lining
written to order, he could not have been more annoyed at being accredited with
it. And now the full garish eye of day was to be let into the inmost recesses of
his heart's sanctuary! &quot;Break lock and seal, betray the trust!&quot; let the whole
world revel in the details. A domestic scandal, and one besmirching a man who,
despite of himself, had made some name in the world, and a woman whose triumphs
had rung through society, was exactly the thing which the &quot;many-headed beast&quot;
would most delight in prying into and bandying about. The details?--there were
no details; none, at least, which the world would ever hear of, or which would
give the smallest explanation of the result. There was the fact of the
separation, and nothing more; what led to it must be the work of conjecture, and
people would invent all kinds of calumny about him; and--great Heaven!--about
her. The lying world, with its blistering tongue, would be busy with her name,
warping, twisting, inventing every thing--perhaps imputing shame to her, to her
whose shield he should have been, to her whom he should have protected from
every blow.</p>
<p>And here must be exhibited one of the flaws in Frank Churchill's
by-no-means-perfect character. His wife had taken a step which nothing could
excuse, had given way to her passion; and, in obedience to the promptings of
rage and jealousy, had done him an irreparable wrong, and covered them both with
a reproach which would cling to them for life,--all this without any thing like
adequate provocation on his part; so that he had been shamefully treated, and,
had he been properly heroic, would have a fair claim upon your compassion, if
not your admiration. But the truth is he was anything but a hero;
notwithstanding the manner in which his hopes had been blighted and his life
wrecked, notwithstanding his having been deserted in that apparently heartless
way by his wife,--he loved her even then with a passionate devotion; and when he
thought of her, perhaps vilified and calumniated, without her natural protector,
wretched and perhaps solitary, he had almost determined to fling his pride--nay,
what he knew to be his duty--to the winds, to rush after her and implore her to
come back to his home, and to do with him what she would. Of course nothing
could have been more degrading to him than such a proceeding, and it was
fortunate that good advice was coming to him in the person of his mother.</p>
<p>Coming in to pay her usual afternoon visit, the old lady walked straight to
the study, and after tapping lightly at the door with her parasol-handle, she
opened it and went in. She found her son seated at his desk, his head buried in
his hands, which were supported by the projecting arms of the chair. His legs
were stretched out before him, and he seemed lost in thought. He did not change
his position at his mother's entrance, not until she addressed him by name;
when, on raising his head, she saw the dull whiteness of his cheeks, and the
bistre rings round his eyes. She noticed too that his hands shook, and on
touching them they were hot and dry.</p>
<p>&quot;My boy,&quot; said the old lady, gently, &quot;you're not well, I'm afraid! what's the
matter with you? too much of this horrid work, or--why, good God, Frank, there
are marks of tears on your face! What <i>is</i> the matter,--what <i>has</i>
happened?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing, mother--nothing to me at least,--don't be alarmed, dearest; I'm all
right enough.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then Barbara's ill!&quot; said Mrs. Churchill, rising from the seat she had
taken. &quot;I'll go to her at once, poor thing--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You wouldn't find her, mother!&quot; said Frank, in a very hollow voice. &quot;She's
not upstairs; she's gone!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Gone! Gone where?&quot; asked the old lady.</p>
<p>&quot;Gone away--left me--gone away for ever!&quot; and as the thought of his
desolation broke with renewed force upon him, his voice nearly failed him, and
it was with great difficulty that he prevented himself from breaking down.</p>
<p>&quot;Left you--gone away--eloped!&quot; cried the old lady, in whose mind there
suddenly arose a vision of a yellow post-chaise, with four horses and two
postillions, and Barbara inside, with Captain Lyster looking out of the window.</p>
<p>&quot;No, no; not so bad as that,&quot; said Frank; &quot;though horrible enough, in all
conscience;&quot; and he gave his mother a description of the scene which had
occurred.</p>
<p>As Mrs. Churchill listened, it was plain to see that she was greatly moved;
her hands trembled, and tears burst from her eyes and stole down her cheeks. As
the story proceeded, two feelings were struggling for the mastery within
her--one, pity for her son; the other, indignation at her son's wife. The old
lady, although now so quiet and retiring and simple, had lived in the world, and
knew the ways and doings, the ins and outs, of its denizens. She had had
tolerable experience of man's inconstancy, of his proneness to sin, of his
exposure to flattery, and liability to temptation. Had Frank confessed some
slight flirtation with a pretty girl, some beneficence towards a female
acquaintance of bygone times, she would have thought that Barbara had acted with
worse than rashness in taking so decided a step; but now, when Frank told her
that the letter which had provoked the final eruption was one which--had he not
been pledged by its writer to be silent concerning, pledge given long before he
had made Barbara's acquaintance--might have been read before the world, she
believed her son fully, and could form no judgment too severe on Barbara's
conduct. She was no vain-glorious Pharisee, to tell of the tithes she had given,
the good she had done; no humbler-minded sinner poured out a nightly tale of
shortcomings and omissions to the Great Father: but when she thought of her own
married life, when she recollected all Vance Churchill's frailties, all his
drinking bouts and intrigues, all his carelessness and idleness, his neglect of
his wife his pettish waywardness, and constant self-indulgence; when she
compared all this with Frank's calm, steady, laborious, good life, and
recollected that under all her provocation her husband had scarcely so much as a
harsh word from her, she felt that Barbara's conduct had been outrageous indeed.</p>
<p>She said nothing at first, though her heart was full. With the tears rolling
down her cheeks, she rose from her chair, and, taking up her position by her
son, fell to smoothing his hair and passing her hand lightly over his brow, as
she had done--oh, how many thousand times!--when he was a child; muttering
softly, &quot;My poor boy! oh, my poor boy!&quot; The gentler spirit which had taken
possession of Frank just before his mother's entrance grew and expanded under
her softening touch. He felt like some swimmer who, after a prolonged buffet
with the angry waves, feels his feet, and knows that a few more strokes will
bring him rest and home. There was a chance of nipping this wretched scandal in
its bud, which was much; there was a chance of bringing his beloved to his side
once more, which was all in all. After a time he broke the silence, cautiously
sounding the depths.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you think there's any chance of this horrible business being put
straight, mother?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>&quot;We are in the hands of God, my boy,&quot; replied the old lady, fervently. &quot;Time
is the great anodyne. HE may think fit to have it all set right in the course of
time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes; but--I mean--you don't think it could be settled at once--to-night, I
mean?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If she were to come back to-night, which she will not, and confess that her
miserable pride and jealousy had driven her forth in a mad fit, and were to ask
pardon, and be as she ought to be--God knows--humble and contrite, I would say
let there be an end of it; forget it all, and strive to live happier for the
future. But if she remains away to-night--well, I don't know what to say;&quot; and
the old lady heaved a very intelligible sigh--a sigh which meant that in such an
event the worst had arrived.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Frank; his mind still dwelling on the little course he had
proposed to himself;--&quot;yes, of course, you don't think it would be right, then,
to go to her--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Go to her!&quot; echoed the old lady.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, go to her, and tell her how utterly wrong she had been--that there was
not the slightest foundation for her suspicions; and that she had acted most
unjustifiably in quitting her husband's house in the manner she has done; and--&quot;</p>
<p>Old Mrs. Churchill had been sitting as if petrified, with her lips wide
apart, during the delivery of this sentence; at this point she thawed into
speech.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you mad, Frank? has your misfortune turned your brain? You propose to go
to her,--this woman, who has brought contempt on you-- and not only on you, on
me and all our name,--and sue to her to come back, and box her ears playfully,
and tell her what a naughty girl she has been! Do you imagine that this affair
is any longer a secret, that it has not been talked over already between Mrs.
Schröder's maid and your servants, between your servants and the tradespeople?
Don't you know that if your wife is absent from your house to-night, the doubt
will become a certainty, and that to-morrow the whole neighbourhood will be
ringing with it? No!&quot; continued the old lady; &quot;it has come, and we must bear it.
If that wicked girl--for I can't help feeling and saying that she is wicked in
her present course--sees her error and repents, it will be your duty to forgive
her and to take her back; but as to your humbling yourself by going to her and
asking her to return, it's not to be thought of for a moment.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I suppose you're right, mother,&quot; was all that Frank said--&quot;I suppose you're
right: we'll wait and see whether she comes back to-night.&quot;</p>
<p>So they waited, mother and son, through that long evening. The day died out,
and the dusk came down, and the lamps were lighted in the streets, and the
pattering feet grew fewer and fewer; and still those two sat without speaking,
without moving, immersed in their own thoughts; and still no Barbara returned.
At length Mrs. Churchill, remembering that her son had had no dinner that day,
grew tenderly solicitous about his health, and, crossing to him, raised his head
and pressed her lips to his, and begged him to rouse himself and eat. And Frank,
who felt himself gradually going mad with the one sad strain upon his thoughts,
said:</p>
<p>&quot;No, mother--not here, at all events. I must shake this off, if only for a
few minutes, or I shall go out of my mind. I'll take a turn in the air; and if I
feel faint or to want any thing, I'll go to the Club and get it. You go home and
to bed, dearest; for you must be thoroughly knocked up with all my worries,
which you are compelled to share; she won't come back to-night--it's all over
now; and to-morrow we must face the future, and see what we're to do with the
rest of our lives.&quot;</p>
<p>So they kissed again, and then went out together: Frank with a dead, dull,
wearying pain at his heart; and his mother, sad enough to see him so sad, but
with some little consolation mingled with her grief at the feeling that this
event was not unlikely to bring her and her son more together again; to give her
the chance of being in more frequent and more affectionate communication with
that being whom she worshipped next to her Creator; of enjoying that to her
inexpressible delight, of having her son &quot;all to herself&quot; again.</p>
<p>Leaving the old lady at the door of her lodgings, Frank strode on at a rapid
pace, neither looking to the right nor to the left, seeing none of the people by
whom he passed, thinking of nothing but his lost love. At length the long
fasting he had undergone began to tell upon him, he felt sick and faint, and
determined to go to his Club to get some refreshment,--not to the Flybynights;
he could not have borne the noisy racket, the bewildering chaff, of that circle
of free-lances; so he strode steadily down to Pall Mall, and turned into the
Retrenchment. Even that solemn temple of gastronomy and politics was far too
lively for him in his then mood. The coffee-room was filled with a number of men
who had dined late, many of whom, just returned from their autumnal expeditions,
and not having met for a couple of months, had &quot;joined tables,&quot; and were loudly
talking over their holiday experiences. All was light and lively and jolly; and
Frank felt, as he sat in the midst of them, like the death's-head at the
banquet. At one table close by his four men were sitting over their wine, one of
the number being rallied by the rest about his approaching marriage. &quot;You're a
lucky fellow, by Jove, Hope!&quot; Frank heard one of them say; &quot;I always said Miss
Chudleigh was the prettiest girl out since the Lexden's year.&quot; &quot;What's become of
the Lexden--didn't she get married or something?&quot; asked another. &quot;Oh, yes!&quot;
answered the first--&quot;married a man who's a member here. I don't know him; but a
cleverish fellow, I believe. No tin--regular case of spoons, they said it was.&quot;
&quot;Mistake that!&quot; said the <i>fiancé</i>, whose future father-in-law was a wealthy
brewer; &quot;spoons is all very well, but it wants something to back it.&quot; &quot;Ah, but
it's not every one that has your luck,&quot; said old Tommy Orme, who just then
joined the party--&quot;nor, I will say, Hope it isn't every one that deserves it, by
Jove!&quot; and on the Hope of that speech, old Tommy determined to borrow a
ten-pound note from his friend on the first opportunity. Frank shuddered as he
listened, and bent his head over his cutlet. &quot;Was there any thing in what those
men had said?&quot; he asked himself, as he walked home. Could it have been that the
state of comparative poverty into which he had brought his wife had soured her
temper, rendered her jealous and querulous, and so disgusted her as to cause her
to avail herself of the first excuse which presented itself for returning to her
former life? It might be so, indeed. If a were, Frank was not disposed to think
of her very uncharitably: he knew the whole wealth of love which he had bestowed
upon her; but he thought that her bringing-up might perhaps have rendered her
incapable of appreciating it; and he went to his solitary bed with a feeling of
something more than pity for his absent wife, after imploring peace to and
pardon for them both in his prayers.</p>
<p>The evening of the next day, however, found him in a very different frame of
mind. Not one word had been heard from Barbara; and the fact of her absence, and
the manner of her departure, had been thoroughly well discussed throughout the
neighbourhood. Early in the morning, Frank, with the conviction that all must
eventually be known, had removed the seal from his mother's lips; and the old
lady's circumstantial account, softened as much as her conscience would
allow,--for she felt really more strongly than she had admitted about Barbara's
defection,--was detailed to various knots of fa-miller friends throughout the
day. The astonishment of the Mesopotamians was immense; immense their horror,
deep the condemnation they poured upon the peccant one. The good women of the
district could not realise what had occurred. If Barbara had eloped, they would
have had some slight glimmering of it; though an elopement was a thing which in
their idea only occurred in highly aristocratic families. They had heard through
the medium of the newspapers, stories of post-chaise followed by post-chaise
speeding along the northern road, guilty wife and &quot;gay Lothario&quot; (Mesopotamian
phrase for cavalier villany varying from seduction to waltzing) in the one,
injured husband in the other. But how a woman could take herself off, leave her
home and her husband, and send a servant for her things afterwards, my dear, as
cool as if she were going by the railway train,--that beat them altogether. But
though they could not understand, they could condemn, and did, in most
unmeasured terms. Whatever the motive might have been, and the most energetic
among them could not find in what was said any thing particularly damnifying
(&quot;in what is said, my dear; but I'm sure there must be something behind all this
that we don't know of, but which will come out some day&quot;),--whatever the motive
might have been, there was the fact; that could not be got rid of or explained
away: Mrs. Frank Churchill had left her home and was not living with her
husband. What more or less could you make of that? Some of them had seen it in
her from the first.</p>
<p>There was something--one section said, in her eye, another in her
manner--which showed discontent, or worse. &quot;Something&quot; in her walk which
displeased many of them greatly--&quot;as though the ground she trod upon was not
good enough for her,&quot; they said. And she who had held her head so high, for whom
none of them were good enough, had come to this. Well, if being a fine lady and
being brought up amongst great people led to <i>that</i>, thank goodness they
were as they were.</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding had been one of the earliest to receive old Mrs. Churchill's
confidence, and had been so much astonished and impressed by what she heard,
that she at once returned home and proceeded to rouse her husband, then
peacefully sleeping off his hard night's work. It must have been something quite
out of the common to have prompted such a step, as George Harding was never
pleased at having his hard-earned rest broken in upon; but on this occasion his
wife thought she had a complete justification. So she went softly into the
closed room, undrew the curtains and let in the full morning sun; then she shook
the sleeper's shoulder and called &quot;George!&quot; Harding roused himself at once and
demanded what was the matter; he always had an idea, when suddenly awakened from
sleep, that something had happened to the paper, either an Indian mail omitted,
or a leader of the wrong politics inserted, or something equally dreadful in its
result; and he had scarcely got his eyes fairly open, when his wife said, &quot;Oh,
my dear, such a terrible thing for poor Churchill!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked George, broad-awake in an instant; &quot;nobody ill?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, no, my dear; much better if it were. She's gone, my dear!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who's gone; what on earth do you mean?&quot; and then his wife told him the story
circumstantially. And after hearing it George Harding dressed himself at once
and went out to see his friend.</p>
<p>He found Churchill sitting in his little study, looking vacantly before him.
There were no signs of work on the desk, no book near him; he had evidently been
sitting for some time in a state of semi-stupor. He was very pale; but he looked
up at the opening of the door and smiled faintly when he saw who it was. There
was something so cheery in dear old George Harding's presence, that it shed
light wherever he went, no matter how dark the surroundings: men who, as they
knelt by the coffins of their wives, had prayed to God to take them then and
there,--men who, contemplating the ruin sweeping down upon them, had horribly
suggestive thoughts of the laudanum-bottle or the pistol-barrel,--had felt the
dark clouds pass away at the sound of his genial voice and the sight of his
hopeful face. But there were tears in George Harding's gray eyes as he took his
friend's hand, and his voice shook a little as he said, &quot;My dear old Frank! my
poor dear fellow!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm hard hit, Harding, and that's the truth. You've heard all about it, of
course?&quot; Frank asked nervously, fearing he might have again to recount the
miserable history.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, my wife has told me,--she heard it from your mother, I believe,--and I
came on at once. Do you know I'm horribly afraid, Frank, that it was from your
taking my advice that this quarrel took place?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your advice?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, about tightening the curb. I told you, if you recollect, that I thought
there should be a greater amount of firmness and decision in your manner to Mrs.
Churchill, and--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, you need not be anxious on that score; it must have come sooner or
later; and it's come sooner, that's all!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And what are you going to do?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do? what do sensible men do when they have troubles? Grin and bear them,
don't they? And so shall I. I can't live alone; so I shall instal my mother here
again, and, I suppose, all will--will be pretty much as it was eighteen months
ago.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was afraid from what my wife said, that I should find you in some such
mood as this,&quot; said Harding sternly. &quot;One would think you were mad, Frank
Churchill, to hear you talk such stuff. Don't you know that Mrs. Churchill is as
much your wife before God and man as she ever was? Don't you feel that she has
done nothing for which even the wretched laws which we in our mighty wisdom have
chosen to frame would justify you in treating her in this way? I can understand
it all; you've been worked upon by the chatter and magging of these silly women
until you've lost your own calm common-sense. But don't you feel now, Frank,
that I'm right? Don't you feel that a fit of rage, a mere wretched passing
temper, is not the thing to separate those whom--you know I use it in no canting
sense--those whom God has joined together? Don't you feel that it is your duty
to go to her, or to send--I'll go if you like, though it's not a very pleasant
office--to point out to her the miserable folly of this course, and to bring her
back to her proper place--her home?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My dear Harding,&quot; said Frank quietly, &quot;I know you are sincere in your
advice, but it is impossible for me to take it. My wife has subjected me to a
very great outrage; and until that is explained and atoned for, I will never
look upon or speak to her.&quot;</p>
<p>Harding would have said something more, but Churchill raised his hand in
deprecation, and then changed the subject.</p>

<h5>THE PAPER BULLET.</h5>
<br>
<p>Like the man and woman in the toy weather-house, Mr. Schröder's two houses
never were &quot;to the fore&quot; at the same time. When the one was lighted, the other
was gloomy; when the one was tenanted, the other was empty; when the one was
decorated, the other was comfortless. As the second breath of summer came
floating over Kensington Gardens, after the may- and apple-blossoms had
disappeared, but long before dust and drouth had settled down on the greensward
and the umbrageous walks of the parks; when there was evinced among young men a
perpetual desire to dine at the Star-and-Garter at Richmond, and an undying
hatred of passing the Sunday within the metropolis; when Mr. Quartermaine began
to wonder where he should stow all his visitors, and Mr. Skindle of the Orkney
Arms began to think of building; when fashionable people thought it no more harm
to sit in their carriages outside Grange's, than to call diamonds 'dimonds,' or
ribbon 'ribbin;' when the Sunday-afternoon attendance at the Zoological Gardens
began to exceed the week-day; when green-peas began to have some taste, and
asparagus to be something else beside stalk and stick,--then the glory of the
Saxe-Coburg-Square establishment showed strong symptoms of waning. The usual
amount of solemn dinner-party had been gone through; every body necessary had
been asked to balls, music, and <i>conversazioni</i>; Mrs. Schröder's taste and
Mr. Schröder's wealth had been exhibited constantly at the Opera and at some of
the most fashionable gatherings in London; and one, if not both, of them longed
for a little quiet. This resulted in the renting of Uplands, when blank misery
fell upon the establishment in Saxe-Coburg Square. All the ornaments and
nicknacks were removed and put away; the chandeliers were shrouded in big
holland bags; the shutters were put up; and the spurious Schröder ancestors
scowled dimly from the wall over a great desert of dining-table, no longer
shining with snowy damask or sparkling silver and glass. The staff of
servants,--the French cook and the Italian confectioner; the ponderous butler,
so frequently mistaken by Mrs. Schröder's West-end friends for a City magnate;
the solemn footman, large-whiskered, large-calved, ambrosial, and most
offensive; the lady's-maid and the buttons,--all, down to the kitchen-maid, who
lived in a perpetual state of grease and dripping, and who was preparing herself
for &quot;plain cook, good,&quot; in the <i>Times</i> column of 'Want Places,'--all went
away into what the said kitchen-maid was heard to designate &quot;that rubbiging
country;&quot; and an old woman, weird, puffy, dusty, with old black silk stitched
about her head where her hair should have been, and with bits of beard sticking
on her chin, came and took up her abode in the housekeeper's room and &quot;kep'
'ouse&quot; herself.</p>
<p>But when October was well set in, and the days grew short, and the showers
not unfrequent; when, even if there were no showers, the heavy mists of morn and
dews of night left the ground moist and dank and plappy; when weird night-winds
rose and sighed Banshee-like over the hushed fields; when the lawn lost its soft
verdure and grew brown and corrugated; when the trees, which during the summer
had so picturesquely fringed the lawn and framed the distance, now gaunt and
dismal, swayed mournfully to and fro, drearily rattling their stripped
limbs,--then a general inclination to return back to the comfort of London began
to be manifested by all the inhabitants of Uplands. It was all very pleasant
when Mr. Schröder had spun his chestnuts up the leafy lanes, or over the breezy
hills, in the summer; but it was a very different thing when he had to come the
same road from town in a close carriage, with the rain pattering against the
windows, and with no gas for the last three miles of the journey. It was dull
work for Mrs. Schröder and whatever female companion she might happen to have,
with nothing to do but yawn over novels, or listlessly thrum the piano, or watch
the gardeners filling their high barrows with dead leaves and unceasingly
sweeping the lawns and paths. She could have relieved her tedium by a little
shopping, she thought; but there were no shops--at least what she called
shops--within miles of Uplands. As to the servants, they all hated the place;
there were no military for the females, and the policemen were all mounted
patrols, who &quot;just looked round at night on 'orseback, and never had no time for
a gossip, or a bit of supper, or anythink friendly;&quot; while the male domestics
were removed from their clubs and all the other delights which a town-life
afforded. So, to the great joy of all, the word was given to march; and the
whole establishment descended on Saxe-Coburg Square leaving Uplands to the care
of the Scotch gardener, who removed his wife and family up from one of the
lodges, and encamped in the kitchen and adjacent rooms.</p>
<p>Mrs. Schröder was by no means ill-pleased at the return to town. The moving
gave her no trouble; she had merely to walk into her rooms and find every thing
arranged for her; and she was in hopes that a salutary change would be effected
in at least one arrangement which was beginning to worry her. The truth is, that
during the last week of their stay at Uplands it had begun to dawn upon Mrs.
Schröder that Charles Beresford's attentions were not what they should be. She
had more than once endeavoured to think out the subject; but her intellects were
none of the brightest, and she got frightened, and either began to cry, or let
every thing go by the board in the grand certainty that &quot;it would be all right
in the end.&quot; But of late she had felt the necessity of taking some steps to
bring the acquaintance between her and her admirer to some proper footing. This
had not come on her entirely of her own accord. She had noticed that her husband
(whose attentions to her increased day by day from the time when his heart
seemed to soften so suddenly and so strangely towards her) seemed to regard the
presence of the Commissioner with obvious impatience. Mr. Schröder never,
indeed, said any thing to his wife on the subject; but he evidently chafed when
Beresford was in the house: and if Mrs. Schröder and Beresford were at all
thrown together apart from the general company, they were sure to see Mr.
Schröder's eyes fixed upon them. Others of her friends had not been so reticent.
Captain Lyster had hinted once or twice, what Barbara Churchill had several
times roundly spoken out--that Beresford was a <i>vaurien</i>, whose attentions
were compromising to any married woman; and that if he had the smallest spark of
gentlemanly feeling in him, he would desist from paying them. So Mrs. Schröder,
who was nothing but a very silly weak little woman (there are few women who are
really bad, even among those who have erred: the Messalinas and the Lady
Macbeths are very exceptional cases), and who really had a sincere affection for
her husband, had made up her mind that she was behaving badly, and had
determined to break gradually, but uncompromisingly, with Mr. Beresford and his
attentions. She had been so completely hoodwinked by the fraternal relations
which, at Mr. Simnel's suggestion, the Commissioner had cultivated, that it was
not until immediately previous to their quitting Uplands that she saw the danger
she had been running, and felt horribly incensed with Mr. Beresford for his part
in the affair.</p>
<p>They had been back for some days in Saxe-Coburg Square, and Alice Schröder
was nestling in her easy-chair after luncheon, wondering when the opportunity
would occur in which she could plainly point out to Mr. Beresford that he must
altogether alter his conduct for the future, when Mrs. Churchill was announced,
and Barbara entered the room.</p>
<p>She was very pale, walked very erect, and held out her two hands to Alice as
she advanced.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, Barbara! Barbara darling!&quot; said impulsive little Alice, &quot;I'm so
delighted to--why, what's the matter, dear? how strange and odd you look!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I want you to have me here for a few days, Alice, if you will.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, of course, dear! I'm so glad you've come at last; it wasn't for the
want of asking, you know. And Mr. Churchill will be here to dinner, dear, at
seven, eh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Churchill will not come at all, Alice,&quot; said Barbara very gravely. &quot;I am
here alone.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But he knows you've come here, doesn't he?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You don't understand me yet, Alice. I have left my husband.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Left your husband! oh, Barbara, how dreadful! how could you!&quot; and Alice
Schröder's face exhibited such signs of unmistakable terror, that for the first
time the magnitude of the step she had taken, and the apparent impossibility of
its recall, seemed to flash upon Barbara. A rush of tears blinded her eyes; and
she held out her hands appealingly, as she said, &quot;You--you don't shrink from me,
Alice?&quot;</p>
<p>Astonishment, nothing more, had caused Mrs. Schröder's trepidation; in an
instant she had rushed forward and wound her arms round Barbara's neck, saying,
&quot;Shrink from you, my darling? why, what madness to suppose such a thing! Where
should you come but to my house, in such a case? Besides, it's nothing, darling,
I suspect, but a temporary little foolish quarrel. Mr. Churchill will be here to
dinner, and take you home with him afterwards.&quot;</p>
<p>But Barbara shook her head and burst into tears, saying that it was a matter
which admitted of no compromise and no amicable settlement. And then, between
floods of crying, she told Alice the outline of the quarrel; dwelling specially
upon Frank's refusal to give up the letter he had received, or to say who was
his correspondent. Alice seemed deeply impressed with the atrocity of Frank's
conduct, though she doubted whether she herself would have had the courage to
take such a decided step as leaving her home (&quot;You always said I was wanting in
spirit, Barbara; and indeed I should not have known where to go to&quot;). She
recollected Barbara's having been upset at a letter which had come to Frank at
Bissett, before they were engaged; and she was full of &quot;O my's!&quot; and general
wonderment, as to who could have written both these mysterious epistles.</p>
<p>&quot;Very odd,&quot; she said--&quot;very odd, and very unpleasant. You're sure it was a
woman's hand, dear? People do make such mistakes about that sometimes. Most
dreadful, indeed! Well, that's one blessing, I've often thought, with Gustav,
and is some compensation for his grayness and his being so much older, and that
sort of thing. For grayness is better than jealousy, isn't it, dear? and I'm
sure it's pleasanter to think of your husband at whist than waltzing, as some of
them do--whirling about the room as though there were no such thing as the
marriage service And letters too, that's awful! I'm so glad you came here,
Barbara darling; and so will Gustav be, when he comes in. We must tell him all
about it. I tell him every thing now, he is <i>so</i> kind.&quot;</p>
<p>He was <i>very</i> kind, this heavy-headed elderly German merchant. When he
came in, his wife at once told him what had occurred; and when he met Barbara in
the drawing-room, before dinner, he took her hands in both of his, and pressed
his lips gravely on her forehead, and bade her welcome, and told her to consider
his house as her home. For Mr. Schröder had, in his strange old-fashioned way, a
very keen sense of honour and of the respect due to women; and he felt, from the
story that had been told to him, that Barbara's feelings had to a certain extent
been outraged. He had never held much good opinion of the literary craft: he
could not understand a calling which did not employ clerks and keep ledgers and
day-books, which did not minister to any absolute requirement, and which only
represented something visionary and fanciful. He shared in a very widespread
notion that the <i>morale</i> of people engaged in that and similar pursuits was
specially liable to deterioration; and he took what he understood to be Frank
Churchill's defection from the paths of propriety as an indorsement of his idea,
and a proof that he had been right in its adoption. He happened to let fall some
remark to this effect, a few words only, and not strongly or savagely put, but
they had immense weight with Barbara Churchill.</p>
<p>For they immediately recalled to her recollection her several interviews with
her aunt, Miss Lexden, when she first announced the engagement with Frank, and
she remembered the acrimony with which the old lady had spoken of the class to
which her intended husband belonged. The very words her aunt had used were
ringing in her ears. &quot;If I were to see you with broken health, with broken
spirits, ill-used, deserted--as is likely enough, for I know these people,--I
would not lift one finger to help you after your degradation of me!&quot; &quot;For I know
these people!&quot; Too well she knew them, it appears, when she predicated what had
actually occurred. Not deserted, though; that at least could never be cast in
her teeth. It was she who had taken the initiative:--she who had broken the
bonds and--what could the world say to that? Would it not denounce her conduct
as strange, unwomanly, and unwifelike? And if it did, what did she care? Her
pride, her spirit, had often been spoken of; and she felt in no way ashamed of
having permitted herself to be swayed by them in this great trial of her life.
There must be many who would thoroughly understand her conduct, and sympathise
with her; and even if there were none, she had the courage and the determination
to stand alone. That she must to a great extent have right on her side--that
what she had done could not be looked upon as extravagant or unjustifiable--was
proved, she argued to herself, by the kind reception she had met with at the
hands of Mr. Schröder, a man who, as she judged from all she had heard and seen
of him; would not be likely lightly to pass over any breach of decorum. How or
where the rest of her life was to be passed engrossed very little of her
attention at first. She knew that there was no chance of reconciliation with her
aunt; nor did she wish it. She had quarrelled with her husband, certainly, and
would never be induced to live with him again; but her cheek flushed when she
remembered what insults had been heaped upon Frank by her aunt; and she thought
almost tenderly of him as she decided that after these insults nothing would
induce her to humiliate herself to Miss Lexden's caprices. The thought of
writing to Sir Marmaduke Wentworth crossed her mind; but Alice Schröder had told
her that Sir Marmaduke was laid up with a dangerous illness in the Pyrenees; it
would be very inopportune to worry him, then, with domestic dissensions; and
moreover Barbara was in very great doubt as to whether the old gentleman, were
he able, would not take an active part in promoting a peace, and whether he
would not strongly disapprove of, and openly condemn, the course she had taken.
He had a very high opinion of Frank Churchill, who was his godson; and unless it
could be distinctly proved that he had committed himself--unless it could be
distinctly proved--could it? what proof was there? had not her pride and spirit
involved her in a snare? how could she make her case good before an unbiassed
judge? There was the letter, and the letter in the same handwriting which he had
received at Bissett; but she had no actual proofs that they were not such as
should have been sent to any properly-conducted man. Great Heaven, if she had
been too precipitate! if she had brought about an <i>exposé</i> by rashness and
wretched jealousy; if she had wrongly suspected that kind and generous soul, and
cruelly stabbed him without hearing his defence! As Barbara turned these matters
in her mind, sitting in her bedroom on the first night of her arrival in
Saxe-Coburg Square, she felt the whole current of her being setting towards
Frank; and she covered with her tears and kisses his miniature which hung in a
locket at her watch-chain. Must this be the end of it? could her fatal folly--if
folly it were--darken the rest of her life? Oh, no! she could never acknowledge
her error,--that would be impossible; her pride would never permit her to take
the first steps towards a reconciliation: but Frank would come--she knew it; he
would come and ask her to return; and she would go; and the rest of their life
should be unclouded happiness.</p>
<p>But Frank did not come; and the next morning when Barbara found the hours
wearing very slowly by, and no solution of her wretchedness arrived at; when
little Alice Schröder's well-meant chatter --well-meant, intended to be
consolatory, but still chatter after all--had utterly failed in giving the
smallest consolation; when Captain Lyster had called, and having been properly
prepared by Mrs. Schröder before he saw Barbara, had evidently the greatest
difficulty in assuming ignorance and unconcern; when the day had worn on, and no
progress had been made by her in any one way,--the bitter spirit rose in her
more strongly than ever, and she felt more and more impressed as to the
righteousness of her cause. The fact that Frank had not come to her, crying
&quot;peccavi,&quot; and imploring her to return, had, to a very great extent, convinced
her that he must have been grievously in the wrong. Fully prepared not merely to
forgive him what he had not done, but to be generous enough to meet him half way
in an advance which ought to have been made by her alone, she was annoyed beyond
description at his making no sign; and each hour that passed over her head
strengthened her obstinacy and deepened her misery.</p>
<p>So several days went by. Barbara resolutely refused to go out; nothing could
induce her to be seen in public, and none were admitted to the house save the
intimate male friends of the family. Barbara stipulated, at once, that no women
should be let in, and Alice, who believed in the most marvellous degree in
Barbara, agreed to it. She did, indeed, suggest one female name, the name of a
lady in whom she was sure, she said, Barbara would find great comfort; but
Barbara, who had some acquaintance with the person in question, hissed out,
&quot;Cat!&quot; with such ferocity, that little Alice never dared again to open the
question. The men-friends were restricted to two or three, among whom Barbara
was glad, for Alice's sake, to find Captain Lyster, and equally glad not to find
Mr. Beresford. She remembered Lyster's confidence to her at Uplands (she had
reason to remember it, she thought with bitterness), and that confidence, though
accidentally distressing to herself, had impressed her with a high notion of the
Captain's truth and honour. She felt as though she would have liked to have
talked to him about her own troubles; but she did not know how to start the
subject, and Lyster never gave her the smallest chance.</p>
<p>On the fourth day after Barbara's arrival, Mrs. Schröder asked her guest, as
usual, if she would drive out after luncheon, and having received the usual
negative, declared that she could not stand it any longer, but that air she must
have. Barbara would excuse her? Of course Barbara would; nothing she liked so
much as being left alone. Then Mrs. Schröder determined on riding, and ordered
her horse and groom round to the door, and went out for a ride.</p>
<p>She though&amp; she would go for a stretch round the suburban lanes; it was
better and more fitted for an unaccompanied lady than the Park. So turning in at
Queen's Gate, she skirted the Row, and riding over the Serpentine bridge turned
up towards Westbourne Terrace, at the end of which, leisurely riding along, she
saw Mr. Beresford. He saw her too, and in an instant was at her side; sitting
his horse to perfection, and bowing with perfect ease and grace. He asked her
where she was riding, and begged to be allowed to accompany her. She had a
refusal on the tip of her tongue; then recollected that she might never have
another chance of speaking to him as frankly and decidedly as she had made up
her mind to speak. So she consented. During the ride, she spoke earnestly and
well; Beresford tried sophistry and special pleading; but they had little chance
with her, so thoroughly in earnest was she. It was while in the height of his
argument that they passed the lodge-gates of The Den, and were seen by Kate
Mellon.</p>
<p>Mrs. Schröder rode home that evening in a happier frame of mind than she had
been in for months. She felt that she had effectually settled all Mr.
Beresford's pretentious, and that she might meet her husband without the
smallest shadow on her brow. Her joy was a little dashed by the receipt of a
letter from her husband, which was put into her hand as she alighted from her
horse. It said that an Egyptian prince, with whom the house had large
transactions, had arrived at Southampton, and that he, Gustav, as representing
the house, was compelled to go down and do the honours to him; that he had
telegraphed to his brother to relieve him as soon as possible; and that he hoped
to be back the next day.</p>
<p>Mrs. Schröder's hopes were realised. In the course of the next afternoon a
cab drove up to the door in Saxe-Coburg Square, and Mr. Schröder descended from
it. His wife, who had rushed to the balcony at the sound of wheels, noticed that
his step was slow, and that--a thing she had never seen him do before--he leant
upon the cabman's arm. When he entered the room she rushed to him, and,
embracing him, asked him how he was.</p>
<p>&quot;I am well, my darling,&quot; he answered; &quot;quite well, but that I have
rheumatism, or something like it. A curious pain--dead, dull, stupid pain--in my
left arm and shoulder. Rheumatism, of course! And you, Barbara, my dear; you are
well? That's right; no news with you, of course? Ah! I have been thinking much
about you in the train, and we will talk to-morrow of your affairs. Well, Alice,
what news? Did you persuade Barbara to drive yesterday?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, she refused again; so I went out on horseback.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, ah! that was right. Alone?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I went alone; but I met Mr. Beresford.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Beresford! I hate that name; he is a bad man. Bad! bad!&quot;</p>
<p>And Mr. Schröder shook his hand in the air, and was obviously very much
excited.</p>
<p>&quot;Gustav,&quot; said Mrs. Schröder, &quot;I'm very sorry that--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, you don't know! More of this Beresford another time. A bad man, my dear!
Now I must look through my letters. Dinner at seven, eh?&quot;</p>
<p>And with a bow, Mr. Schröder descended to his library.</p>
<br>
<p>The clock had struck seven, the gong had boomed through the house, and Alice
and Barbara were standing at the dining-table; the place at the head being
vacant.</p>
<p>&quot;You had better tell your master, Pilkington,&quot; said Mrs. Schröder to the
great butler; &quot;he is probably in his dressing-room.&quot;</p>
<p>The great butler condescended to inform his mistress that he did not think
his master had left the libery.</p>
<p>Mrs. Schröder then bade him find his miter, and tell him they were waiting
dinner.</p>
<p>The butler left the room, and the next moment came running back, with a face
whiter than his own neckcloth. Barbara saw him ere he had crossed the threshold;
in an instant she saw that something had happened; and motioning the butler to
precede her, walked to the library, followed by Mrs. Schröder.</p>
<p>Fallen prone on his face, across the library-table, lay Mr. Schröder, dead,
with an open letter rustling between his stiffening fingers.</p>

<h5>HALF-REVEALED.</h5>
<br>
<p>As Kate Mellon had soliloquised, some time had elapsed since Mr. Simnel had
visited The Den. A wary general, Mr. Simnel; a man who, like the elephant, never
put his foot forward without first carefully feeling the ground in front of him,
and trying whether it would bear; a man who, above all, never was in a hurry. He
had not gone through life cautiously and with his eyes wide open without
remarking how frequently a little impulse, a little over excitement or yielding
to headstrong urging, had led to direful results.</p>
<p>&quot;No hurry&quot; was one of his choicest maxims: to sleep upon an idea; to let
information just received mellow in his mind until he saw the very best way to
utilise it; to brood over the most promising projects, carefully sifting the
chaff from the grain; to wait patiently until the two or three shadowy
alternatives had, after due inspection, resolved themselves into one broad path,
impossible to be shrunk from--that was Mr. Simnel's way of doing business. He
never allowed the iron to be overheated. So soon as it was malleable, he
struck--struck with irresistible force and sure aim; but he never dallied with
the half-heated metal, or tried warpings with pincers, or blind struggles with
solid resistance. If he had a fault in his worldly dealings, it was that he
delighted in hiding the power which he was able to wield, even beyond the
legitimate time for its manifestation. There are men, you will have observed,
who, in playing whist and other games of chance and skill,--long-headed
calculators, far-seers, sticklers for every point of Hoyle,--yet cannot resist
the temptation of withholding their ace until the best time for its production
is long past, solely for the sake of causing a sensation, for the sake of
creating a feeling of astonishment among their fellow players that the great
card has been all that time in hand. So it was, to a certain extent, with Robert
Simnel.</p>
<p>He had known nothing of love, this man, during his youth. He had had no time
for the cultivation of any tender passion. He had been brought up roughly, with
his own way to make, with his own living to get. He was not pretty to look at,
and no ladies felt an interest in smoothing his hair or patting his cheeks. The
matron at the Combcardingham grammar-school,--a sour blighted old maid, a poor
sad old creature, who yet retained some reminiscences of hope in her forlorn
frame; in whom head-washing and looking after linen had not obliterated all
traces of feminine weakness, and who remembered early days, when she dreamed
that some day some one might make her some kind of a marriage offer, dreams
which had never been fulfilled,--this weird sister had her favourites among the
boys; but Simnel was not of them. They were mostly fat-headed, sleek-faced boys,
apply, rubicund, red-lipped, and shiny; boys with reminiscences of home, who
kissed Miss Wardroper as a kind of bad substitute for Ma, and who traded on
their blowing beauty to be let off easily on tub-night, and to have advances of
pocket money before the regular day. Robert Simnel had no share in these
pettings; he was what Miss Wardroper considered an &quot;uncomfortable lad;&quot; he was
&quot;nothing to look at;&quot; and preferred lying on his stomach under trees with a book
between his elbows, on which his face was resting, or sitting bolt upright,
trying to catch on his page the glimmer from the school-fire, to all the
cossettings of the housekeeper's room. In immediate after-life his course of
conduct was pretty much the same. Combcardingham was not a moral town. Many of
the pretty girls who worked hard all day dressed in great finery in the
evenings, and proceeded to the theatre, to the gardens, to the <i>al-fresco</i>
entertainments with which the suburbs of the town were studded, attended by the
youth of the place. The conveyancing-clerk of Messrs. Banner and Blair, the
common-law ditto, and the Chancery manager, were accustomed to speak of Annie,
and Emmy, and Fanny, as though the establishment of those eminent lawyers had
been the Hotel-Dieu, and they the interlocutors had been Parisian students
instead of provincial lawyers; the very copying-clerk, who served writs, and
fetched beer for the gentlemen in the inner office, had been seen to wink his
eye, and heard to mention some such article as &quot;a bit of muslin.&quot; But Robert
Simnel had remained adamant. They dared not chaff him; there was something in
his manner which forbade any approach to familiarity. Some of the ribalds had
once set some of their female friends to get a rise out of the quiet studious
shame-faced young man; but the girls had been met with perfect politeness, mixed
with such studied coldness, that the game was given up in despair. From that
time until he came up to London, Simnel was left unworried.</p>
<p>His life in town was equally cold and celibate. He moved very little in the
female society of his own class; not that he was unwelcome, but that he disliked
it. It bored him; and that was the worst thing that could happen to him when
once his foot was fairly set on the ladder. In the old days he had endured men,
women, parties, society,--all utterly repugnant to his feelings and tastes; and
he had vowed that, should he ever have the power, the severance of such
obligatory ties would be the first luxury in which he would indulge; and he kept
his word. &quot;My lady,&quot; would chirp little Sir Hickory Maddox,--&quot;my lady has bid me
bring you this note of invitation to dine with us next Wednesday, Simnel.
Formal, you perceive; for you are such a well-known stickler for formalities,
that we fain must treat you à la Grandison;&quot; and then Sir Hickory, who prided
himself on the construction of his sentences, would double up his little head
into his ample cravat, and bow in a mock heroic manner. But Mr. Simnel managed
to find an excuse for not attending the solemn dinners of his chief; nor did he
ever attend the pleasant <i>réunions</i> of Mrs. Gillotson and Mrs. Franks,
wives of the senior officers of his department, to which he was bidden. Of
course, as a bachelor, it was not supposed that he should receive lady visitors;
and though his rooms in Piccadilly had witnessed certain scenes which their
proprietor described as <i>petits soupers</i>, but which the mother-in-law of
the serious saddler who held the shop below openly proclaimed as &quot;orgies,&quot; at
which certain distinguished <i>coryphées</i> of Her Majesty's Theatre were
present, and there was lots of fun and laughter and champagne, and an impromptu
galop after supper,--no one could tax Simnel with any decided flirtation. He had
been very polite to, more than that, very jolly with every body, thoroughly
hospitable, genial, and kind; but when they broke up, and Punter Blair put Fanny
Douglas into a cab, and Sis Considine walked away with Kate Trafford and her
sister Nelly, and the whole party turned out laughing and singing into the
street, Robert Simnel went round the rooms and put out the wax-lights, and
picked up bits of lobster-shell and cracker-paper from the floor, and, yawned
confoundedly, and was deuced glad it was over.</p>
<p>So he went on his way through life, with that way unillumined by one spark of
love until he first saw Kate Mellon. How well he recollected every circumstance
connected with the first glimpse of her! It was on a glorious spring afternoon
at the beginning of the season; he was walking with Beresford (with whom he was
just beginning to be intimate) through the Row, when he noticed the heads of the
promenaders all turned one way; and following the direction, he saw a mounted
female figure coming at a rapid pace down the ride. The horse she sat was a
splendid black barb, an impetuous tearing fellow, who had not yet learned that
he was not to have his own way in life, and who was making the most desperate
struggle to recover such submission as he had been compelled to yield. In and
out, in and out, from side to side, he bounded, obedient to the light hand, the
scarcely tapping whip and the swerving body of his rider; but his foam-flecked
chest and his sweat-rippled neck showed how unwillingly he accepted his lesson.
At length, on catching sight of Beresford, who left Simnel's arm and walked to
the rails, Kate drew rein, and, while she gave one hand to her acquaintance, she
relaxed the other until the horse had full play for his stretching neck. Simnel
stood amazed at her beauty and at the perfect outline of her supple figure. She
was just exactly his style. Mr. Simnel had no admiration for Grecian features or
classic mould. Ebon tresses and deep dreamy eyes were little regarded by him;
his taste was of the earth, earthy; piquancy of expression, plumpness of form,
was what he, to use his own expression, &quot;went in for.&quot; He would not have
bestowed a second glance upon Barbara Churchill; but Kate Mellon was exactly to
his taste. He filled his eyes and his heart with her as she sat talking to
Beresford that day; the sweeping lines of her habit, the dainty little
handkerchief peeping out of the saddle-pocket, the dogskin gauntlets, the neat
chimney-pot hat, the braided hair, the face flushed with exercise,--all these
lived vividly in his remembrance, and came in between his eyes and letters for
signature to irascible correspondents and long accounts of indebted tax-payers.
He was not long in obtaining an introduction to his idol; and then he saw at
once, with his innate sharpness, that he had but little chance of pressing his
suit. Long before that <i>éclaircissement</i> which Beresford had described to
him, Simnel saw the state of affairs in that direction, and knew what Kate
Mellon fondly hoped could never be realised. He did not think that the girl ever
would have the chance of so plainly stating the position of affairs; but he knew
Beresford well enough to be certain that moral cowardice would prevent his
availing himself of the position offered to him. Nor did Simnel blame him in
this; that far-seeing gentleman knew perfectly that for any man in society to
ally himself in matrimony to a woman with a reputation which was equivocal
simply from her profession, no matter how excellent the individual herself might
be, was sheer madness. &quot;It isn't,&quot; he argued to himself, &quot;as though I were a
landed proprietor or a titled swell, who could throw the aegis of my rank and
position over her, and settle the question. Heaps of them have done that; dukes
have married actresses of queer names and women of no name at all, and all the
past life has been elegantly festooned over with strawberry-leaves. I'm a
self-made man, and they hate me for that, though my status is now such that they
can't deny it; but then they'd immediately begin to ask questions about my wife;
and if there were a chance of flooring us there, we should be done entirely.&quot;</p>
<p>So when Mr. Beresford had told the story of his adventure with Kate Mellon,
Mr. Simnel, who had very much slacked off the scent, purely from want of
encouragement and a chance of seeing his way, returned to the charge with
renewed vigour. Beresford had faithfully repeated to his Mentor every word of
Kate's wild outburst; and in that sudden revelation Simnel, nothing amazed
thereby, had found a strong incentive to farther exertion. Kate had hinted at
relatives of whom her future husband need not be ashamed. Who were they? That
was one of the first points to be found out, He wisely looked upon Charles
Beresford as now cleared out of his way. It was not for nothing that Mr. Simnel
had read at the Combcardingham grammar-school of the <i>spretae injuria formae</i>;
and he knew that the Commissioner had probably committed himself for ever in the
eyes of the lady of The Den. Nevertheless, to make assurance doubly sure, he at
once used all his influence towards turning Beresford's views in another
direction; thus farther irritating Kate's pride, and preventing any chance of a
reconciliation; for this apparently phlegmatic man of business, this calm,
calculating, long-headed dry chip of an official, loved the little woman with
his whole heart and strength, and determined to miss no opportunity of so
winning her regard by his devotion to her cause, and by the tangible results
springing therefrom. That must tell in the end, he thought. She is now
heart-sore about Beresford; she has discovered the foundation of sand on which
her first little castle was built; and now she will not touch the ruins or lay
another stone. There is but one way to arouse in her any new life,--the keynote
to be touched is ambition. If there be any truth in her assertion that the is
sprung from a race of which she can be proud, one may work it through that. So
Mr. Simnel worked away. He speedily found that Kate's own knowledge of her
origin was cloudy in the extreme; but he possessed, in a rare degree, the
faculty of putting two and two together and making four of them very rapidly;
and he had not been very long chewing the cud of poor Kitty's stories of the
circus, and the uncle, and all the rest of it, before he saw a clue which sent
him spinning far into Northumberland by express-train to a place where he saw
the circus which Kate had named was advertised in those wonderful column <i>Era</i>
as then performing.</p>
<p>No one accompanied Mr. Simnel on that journey; no one knew what he did or
what he heard; but as the chronicler of these mild adventures, I may state that
though not in the least astonished at what was--after a free pecuniary
disbursement--imparted to him, he came back to London radiant. The clerks in the
Tin-Tax Office did not know what to make of him; some of the young ones thought
he had got married; but at that suggestion the older men shook their heads. That
was the last thing, they opined, to cause an access of animal spirits. He might
have come in for a legacy, or taken the change out of some body whom he hated;
that was all they could see to account for his cheerfulness. Two or three of the
men, Mr. Pringle of course among the number, improved the occasion by asking for
a day or two's leave of absence; a request at once granted by the smiling
secretary, who, on the day after his return, announced his intention of making a
half-holiday, and wound his way towards The Den. He rode through the lodge-gate,
and exchanged salutations with the rosy porteress; but as he turned into the
carriage-drive he perceived Freeman, the old stud-groom, standing at the
entrance to the stables, alert and expectant. As soon as the old man recognised
Simnel, he advanced towards him, and motioned him towards the farmyard. Simnel
turned his horse's head in that direction, and when he arrived inside the gates
and on the straw-ride, old Freeman held his bridle as he dismounted.</p>
<p>&quot;A word wi' you, sir,&quot; said the old man, putting his finger on his lip and
nodding mysteriously.</p>
<p>Mr. Simnel looked astonished, but said nothing, as the old groom called to a
helper, to whose care he relinquished the horse; then taking Simnel into a
little room and planting him in the midst of a grove of girths and stirrups, the
saddles of which formed an alcove above him, the old man produced a short set of
steps, and motioning to Simnel to seat himself on the top of them, took up his
position immediately in front of him, and said, in a voice intended to be low,
but in reality very hissingly sonorous,--</p>
<p>&quot;Waät be matther?&quot;</p>
<p>It was seldom that Mr. Simnel was nonplussed, but this was beyond him. He had
only caught one word, and that he thought better to repeat. So he merely
ejaculated &quot;matter?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ay, matther!&quot; echoed the old man, this time in rather an angry tone. &quot;Waät
be matther down yon?&quot; jerking his head towards the house. Mr. Simnel thought
that the man was presuming on his position to take liberties, a very terrible
crime in his eyes, so he simply elevated his thick eyebrows and echoed, &quot;Down
yon?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thou knowst waät a mean, sir, weel enow. Waät be matther wi' my leddy? waät
be matther wi' my bright lassie ai've tended this ever so long?&quot; and the old
man's face puckered up into wrinkles, and he produced from his hat a cotton
handkerchief, with which he rubbed his eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean. Freeman? I didn't follow you until this instant. Is--is
your mistress ill?&quot; asked Simnel.</p>
<p>&quot;No, not ill; that's to say waät folks call ill; always greetin', that waät
she is,--thinkin' of something yon,--givin' no heed to waät goes on close to her
face. Eyes lookin' far away out into the distance; no thowt of the stock such as
she had; hasn't been into the farrier's shop these three weeks,--blister here,
singe there, do as 't loikes; Miss never says nay now, and that's bad sign; for
a more thrifty body never stepped.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, she doesn't take such interest, you mean, in what goes on here as she
did.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Int'rest! She cares nowt aboot it!&quot; said the old man. &quot;Ther' soommut oop,
soommut wring! that's what thee is. Ther' can't have been no one a philanderin'
wi' her, on and off like,--you understand?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I should think not,&quot; said Mr. Simnel, with a face as solid as a rock.</p>
<p>&quot;If I'd thowt that,&quot; said old Freeman, &quot;and I'd found 'em out, I'd beat 'ems
brains out as if it were a stoat!&quot; and as he spoke he struck the palm of his
hand with the handle of his hunting-whip in an unmistakably vicious manner.
&quot;Dunno waät's coom to her to-day,&quot; he continued, after a pause; &quot;haven't set
eyes on her all the morning. Hasn't been in t'yard, hasn't been in t'staäbles,
hasn't moved out of t'house.&quot;</p>
<p>This latter part of Freeman's speech seemed to arouse Mr. Simnel's fading
attention; he looked up sharply, and said,</p>
<p>&quot;Not been out of the house all the morning! what does that mean? Who was here
yesterday?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday,&quot; said the old man slowly considering; &quot;there were Sandcrack coom
oop about Telegram's navicular,--no more navicular than I am; nowt but a
sprain;--and Wallis from Wethers's wi' a pair o' job grays; and old Mr. Isaacson
as tried some pheayton 'osses; and--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; said Mr. Simnel; &quot;no young man; no one in the habit of coming
here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not one,&quot; said Freeman.</p>
<p>&quot;That's devilish odd,&quot; said Mr. Simnel, half to himself; &quot;what the deuce has
happened to upset her? I'll go in and see. Good-day, Freeman; I've brought some
good news for your mistress, and I hope we shall soon see her herself again.&quot;</p>
<p>The old man touched his hat, as Simnel walked off to the house, where he
found Kate's servant, and learnt from her that her mistress had kept her room
all the morning, complaining of headache. From this domestic Mr. Simnel had a
repetition of old Freeman's story. Not only had she seemingly lost all interest
in her business, which formerly so thoroughly engrossed her attention, but for
the last few months she had been in every respect a thoroughly changed woman.</p>
<p>&quot;I've been with her four year,&quot; said the woman, holding her hands clasped in
front of her, and beating time with them at the conclusion of each sentence;
&quot;four year I've been with her, and never see no megrims. A cheerfuller
lighter-hearteder lady there were not, so long as you was quick. Every thing
must be done directly minute, and all was right. But latterly there's been
nothink but megrims and lowness of sperrits, and no caring for what we wears or
what we eats, or whether we eats at all, indeed.&quot; This and much more to the same
effect, only cut short by Simnel's requesting the woman to take his name to her
mistress, and say he was anxious for a few words with her.</p>
<p>He sat down in the dining-room and took up a <i>Bell's Life</i> which lay on
the table; but had hardly glanced at it when the door was hurriedly thrown open
and Kate entered. She was perfectly colourless and trembled violently. As she
gave her cold hand to Simnel, she asked at once,</p>
<p>&quot;What's the matter, Simnel? what's brought you here? Something particular to
say, they tell me. What is it?&quot;</p>
<p>Though Mr. Simnel was in reality very much shocked at the change which had
taken place in her personal appearance, he did not betray it by look or word.
There was not a break in his voice as, retaining her hand between his, he said,</p>
<p>&quot;Why, Kate, is this your hospitality? is this the way you receive visitors,
demanding their business in this pistol-to-the-head fashion? Suppose I were to
say that my pressing business was to look at and to talk to you..</p>
<p>&quot;No, no, Simnel; no nonsense. At least not now, please; as much as you like
when you've answered me. There hasn't been a--I mean he hasn't--you
haven't--confound it, Simnel, why don't you help me?&quot; and she stamped her foot
upon the floor in rage.</p>
<p>&quot;Kate, Kate,&quot; said he, still quietly, though this little evidence of her
excited state touched him very deeply, &quot;I can't tell what is the matter with you
to-day. I've come to talk to you and to tell you a little news about
yourself--that's all.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;About myself? not about--I mean about no one else? Nothing has happened?
nothing--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing that I know of. I only arrived in town late last night, and I have
seen no one this morning. What on earth did you expect? Now you're flushing
again! My dear Kate, you're not well, child; you must--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm all right now,&quot; said she, withdrawing her hand; &quot;I'm all right again. It
was only some stupid nonsense; I'm a bit nervous, I think.. I'll have some
change of air, and see what that will do. I'm as nervous as a cat. Had a girl
here for a lesson yesterday. Fine girl, sister of Dick Hamilton's--Dirty Dick's,
you know; and she wanted to see me put her horse at the brook. The brute
refused, and I couldn't put him at it the second time--lost my pluck--funked it
myself--fancy that! First time such a thing ever happened to me!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You want change and rest, Kitty,&quot; said Simnel, kindly. &quot;And you want rest of
mind much more than mere respite from bodily fatigue. Your life lately has been
past in a series of storms, in which you have been tossed about, and whirled
here and there, in a manner which is now beginning to tell upon you. Now, all
these starts and flushes and tremors to-day are the result of some fresh worry.
What happened yesterday?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Happened yesterday?&quot; echoed Kate, flushing deeply as she spoke; &quot;nothing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who was here?&quot; asked Simnel, in a mild tone of voice, but fixing his eyes
full on her.</p>
<p>&quot;Here? who? How dare you question me in this way? Who are you to come worming
and prying into my affairs? I never asked you to come, and I sha'n't be sorry
how soon you go!&quot;</p>
<p>He was not an atom moved at this outburst of rage, at these taunts; at least
he did not appear so. He only shook his head, and said sorrowfully,</p>
<p>&quot;Unfair, Kitty; horribly unfair. I've just come back from a journey of
hundreds of miles, undertaken for the object of what you are pleased to term
'worming and prying into your affairs;' and this is all the thanks I get.&quot;</p>
<p>She seized his hand, and pressed it warmly. &quot;There, there! forget it: it's
all part and parcel of my nervousness, that I was telling you about. Now you
shall know who was here yesterday. Beyond the usual business-people, only one
man--Scadgers the money-lender!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Scadgers! The deuce he was! What brought him? Did he come to--no, that's
impossible. What did bring him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now it's you that are muttering to yourself, Simnel,&quot; said Kate. &quot;Make your
mind easy; a letter from me brought him here. I wanted a little assistance.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Stuff, Kitty! What on earth--oh, I see now. You little flat! you've been
paying young Prescott's bills for him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, what if I have? You don't mind.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mind! not I. I love you better for it. Oh, I see you smile; but I've been
making a few inquiries at the Office since I was here last, and I find that it
is a case with your pupil and him. He's a fine young fellow, and will do well.&quot;
It is astonishing how, when we are no longer jealous of a man, his good
qualities crop out.</p>
<p>&quot;He is a good fellow; a thoroughly good fellow; a gentleman in every
thought,&quot; said Kate; &quot;and it was only right to give him a clean start again. All
young men--all who are worth any thing--kick up their heels at first; and then
some fools pull them in tight, and they get sulky and vicious, and never run
straight afterwards. But if they're held straight in hand, and have just enough
rein given them, they right themselves very soon, and go as square as a die.
You'll see now that James Prescott will marry, and settle down into a regular
humdrum life, and be as happy as the day. That's the only existence, Simnel.
Lord help us! They talk of the pleasures of excitement,--the miserable fools, if
they only knew!&quot; and Kate heaved a deep sigh, and buried her face in her hands.</p>
<p>&quot;Come, come, Kitty,&quot; said Simnel, &quot;this will never do. Nothing that you've
said can reasonably be applied to your own case. You've had the enjoyment of one
style of life, and now let us hope the joys of the other are rapidly coming upon
you. You shake your head again. What on earth is the matter with you, child?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can't tell, Simnel,&quot; said the girl, raising her tear-blurred face. &quot;I
can't tell. I've a horrible weight here,&quot; placing her hand upon her heart,--&quot;a
something hanging over me; a presentiment of something about to happen,--and I
haven't the least notion what,--that never leaves me. I'm as flat as a bad
bottle of champagne. By the way, I think I'll try whether a glass of that
Madeira wouldn't--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, no, Kitty; for heaven's sake keep off that! The lift given by that is
only temporary, and you're twice as down as you were before, when it subsides.
You've never asked me one word about my journey yet.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your journey! What journey? Oh, to be sure, you said you'd been away, and on
my business. Where did you go to?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To Newcastle-on-Tyne. To Norton's Fields, just beyond the town; where--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Norton's Fields! Newcastle! Why that's where we used to make our pitch with
old Fox's Circus, and--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And that's exactly the place where old Fox's Circus is pitched at this
moment.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did you go to it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, Kitty, can't you understand that, after what you told me the other day,
to visit it, and glean information from its people, was the sole cause of my
journey?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And did you see them all? Is old Fox still alive; and Madam, with her deep
voice and big bony hands; and Lucette and Josephine--big girls now, and doing
the <i>haute-école</i> business, I suppose; and Brownini, the clown, is he with
them yet? and Thompson the barebacked-rider--a conceited beast, he was!--and old
Bellars the band-leader? Lord, Lord what happy times those were! happier than I
shall ever see again, I know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nonsense, Kate. Your life is just now at its turn. All those horrid days of
grinding labour in the circus, all the hard work you've done here, shall be to
you like a dream. You shall be a swell, and hold your own with the best of them.
Ay, and not merely in money,--I offered you that long since,--but I wanted to
prove a position for you, and I <i>have</i> proved it, Kitty, my darling!&quot; and
Mr. Simnel's usually pale cheeks glowed, and his eyes glistened, and he squeezed
Kate's hand in the excitement of his feelings.</p>
<p>&quot;You've found out whose child lam, Simnel?&quot; asked Kate.</p>
<p>&quot;Every thing! I've only got to see your father, and wring from him the
confession,--and I have the means of doing that, as safe as houses--and you
shall be put in your proper position at once, Kitty, and a capital position it
is, too. Your father is a man of great wealth, very highly thought of, moving in
the best circles, and eminently respectable.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And his name?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, that I mustn't tell you till next time we meet. It's due to him to let
him know how much we have learned, and to give him the option of behaving
properly. If he refuse, I can put such a screw on him as will compel him at once
to do as we wish. And then, Kitty,&quot; continued Simnel, dropping his voice, and
looking at her fondly from under his bushy eyebrows &quot;when all my work for you is
satisfactorily finished, I shall come to you and ask for my reward.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You shall have it, Robert,&quot; she said simply, placing her hand in his. It was
the first time she had called him by his Christian name, and as he heard it a
thrill of delight ran through him.</p>
<br>
<p>Mr. Simnel had ridden away homeward, and Kate had thrown herself on a sofa in
the dining-room, and was vacantly watching the purple gloom creeping up and
ingulphing the landscape. Vacantly, I say; for though her eyes were fixed on it,
she heeded it not. Simnel's description of his visit had awakened in her a
thousand memories of old days. The smell of the stables, the tan, and the
sawdust of the ring; the lamps, and the orange-peel in the marquee; the way in
which the tent-poles would strain and crack in a high wind, and the audience
would look up, as though expecting the crazy edifice to descend on their heads;
the swinging naphtha-burners flaring in the draught; the dull flopping sound of
the first drops of a thunder-shower on the tent roof, causing an immediate
consternation and whispering among the non-umbrellaed spectators,--all these
rose before her mind. She recollected all the different stages of her own
novitiate; heard old Fox's thin piping voice cursing her freely for &quot;missing her
tip&quot; in clearing the garters, or sticking in the silver-papered hoop; and his
wife's hoarse growling at her extravagance in tarlatan skirts and rose-pinked
stockings. Then, pursuing this train of thought, she remembered what Simnel had
said about her parentage; and stung with a sudden idea she sat upright on the
sofa, unconsciously tapping her teeth with her nails. Could it not all be made
straight? That was what she thought. Her father was a man of position, a man
highly thought of and esteemed--so Simnel had said; he could be forced to
recognise her as his daughter,--Simnel swore he should do this. What, then,
stood in the way of her being reconciled to, of her being married to Charles
Beresford? She had plenty of money as it was, and if her father were rich as
stated, could have the command of more. It was her position, the horse-breaking
business, that had floored Charley; she saw that at once; but now here she was a
recognised swell, bar the illegitimacy; and Charley wouldn't mind that with
money, and above all with love--oh, such love!--for him. He would give up every
one else for her; he would give up that fair-haired woman--Ah, good God! the
letter! that fatal letter, which she wrote in her mad passion of yesterday! that
wild wicked letter was fatal! it would be shown to him; her handwriting would be
recognised, and there would be an end to all her hopes.</p>
<p>When the servant came in with the dinner-tray she found her mistress in a
swoon.</p>

<h5>THE HOUSE OF MOURNING.</h5>
<br>
<p>Dead! had been dead for half an hour!--so said the first man with an approach
to medical knowledge who was called in, and who indeed was a worthy chemist who
lived in the neighbourhood, and who, on the strength of a square shop fitted
with an oil-cloth floor, with a little fountain in the centre (in the basin of
which half-a-dozen bottles of aerated water were always cooling), of a counter
bearing glazed cases of scents and cosmetics, of a nest of drawers labelled with
illegible half-words, and of three large shining coloured bottles in the window,
was regarded by the servants in the vicinity as a weird practitioner indeed. A
servant had been despatched in a cab for Dr. Prater; but in the interval pending
that luminary's arrival, Mr. Canthar, of the Medical Hall, was master of the
position, and all those who were left with the body hung upon his words. It--it
had already come to be called &quot;it&quot;--still lay in the library, where it had been
found. Mrs. Schröder, who had hurried in close behind Barbara, had, at the very
first glimpse of the state of affairs, gone off into a violent fit of hysterics,
and had been removed to her room, whither Barbara had followed her, and where
the latter was now in close attendance upon her stricken friend. When Mr.
Canthar arrived (he had stripped off his black-calico apron and thrown it into
the cork-drawer on being summoned, and completed his toilette <i>en route</i> by
running his fingers through such hair as remained on the sides of his head), he
found Mr. Schröder's body stretched out on the sofa in the library, and attended
solely by the kitchen-maid and by a page-boy, who, partly from love to the
kitchen-maid, partly from gratitude to his employers, bore her company. The
other servants had declined having any thing to do with such horrors, as not
coming within their engagements. The great butler had retired to the
housekeeper's room, taking with him a bottle of brown sherry, and there these
supreme functionaries sat, discussing future prospects; the French cook had gone
out to announce to a friend of his, who was steward at a crack club, that he was
now open to an engagement; the two footmen, great hulking masses of ignorance
and vanity, with faces whiter than the powder on their heads, sat in the pantry,
shaking over one glass of hot gin-and-water, and solemnly glozing over the
probability of a suggestion made by one of them that &quot;he&quot; (they had never named
him) had died of &quot;spuntanus kymbustium.&quot; When Mr. Canthar's sharp ring came at
the bell, they both trembled violently, and went up together to open the door.
The announcement that their master was dead,--an announcement made by Mr.
Canthar after a very cursory examination,--utterly failed in reassuring them; on
the contrary, it produced the liveliest symptoms of fright, and they
incontinently hurried down stairs to the pantry again. Mr. Canthar required but
a very short examination to arrive at his verdict. He placed his finger on the
pulse, his ear to the waistcoat; then he took a candle from the attendant
kitchen-maid, and looked for an instant into the half-closed glazed eyes. Gently
depositing the hand, he said, &quot;Dead! quite dead! been dead for half-an-hour, I
suppose. I'm not called upon to state to you my opinion of the cause of death;
indeed, it would be quite useless; and as no member of the family has done me
the honour to be present,--well, no matter, never mind.&quot; Then, in a whisper,
&quot;I'd put a cloth round the jaws, don't you know? just bind it together,
because--ugly appearance, you understand, Martha--good-night;&quot; and Mr. Canthar
tripped out of the house, and devoted the remainder of the evening to working
out a composition for the nutriment of the hair, which, under the name of
Canthar's Crinibus, has an enormous circulation over the infant heads of
Albertopolis.</p>
<p>Half-an-hour after he had received the message from the servant who had been
despatched for him, Dr. Prater spun up in his little low carriage,--hung on C
springs to prevent the doctor's highly sensitive organisation being disturbed by
bumps or jolts over the horrible pavement,--and drawn by a pair of little bays,
which might have been the property of any <i>millionaire</i> in the land. The
great butler condescended to leave the society of the housekeeper, and to rouse
himself so far as to hold open the drawing-room door for the doctor's entrance;
also to produce a decanter and a couple of glasses; and placing them at the
doctor's elbow, to croak out, &quot;Our '20, sir!&quot; and to fill a wine-glass.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, thank ye, Pilkington,&quot; said the little doctor, taking up the glass, and
holding it between his eye and the candle; &quot;this is a dreadful thing,
Pilkington.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; said the butler, shortly; &quot;it's ill-conwenient. Do you find the
wine agreeable to your taste, sir?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, yes, thank ye. I want you now to show me--ah, here's some one coming;&quot;
and the door opened, and Barbara Churchill entered the room.</p>
<p>&quot;Mrs. Schröder is very ill, doctor; you must see her before you go, if you
please; in her absence I will conduct you. Pilkington--oh, there are lights, I
suppose?--this way, doctor;&quot; and she led the way to the library. This had been
Barbara's first experience of death, and it was a severe trial for her, broken
down as she was with her other miseries; but she saw how utterly helpless poor
little Alice Schröder was, and she determined to help to bear the misery of her
sudden misfortune. So she preceded Dr. Prater to the library; and when she had
opened the door, she beckoned to the kitchen-maid and page-boy, who were sitting
bolt upright on the edge of their chairs, and let the doctor enter by himself,
she returning to the dining-room. In a very few minutes she was joined by the
little doctor, who had in the passage composed his face to its usual aspect by
this time. &quot;Not the slightest hope, my dear madam,--not the slightest hope. If I
had been here the minute after, I could not have been of the least assistance.
Must have been instantaneous, my dear madam,--instantaneous,--disease of the
heart,--under which I long knew he laboured; but I never told him. What was the
need? I've said to myself fifty times, 'Prater, you should tell Mr. Schröder of
his danger;' and then, again, I've said to myself, 'What's the use? Mr.
Schröder's not a man to relax those gigantic enterprises in which he is engaged,
on the mere word of a theorist like myself. He'll only be annoyed at my
interference.' There was no cause for any excitement, any special excitement, my
dear miss? Pardon me; to whom have I the pleasure of speaking?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am Mrs. Churchill,--I was Miss Lexden,--a very intimate friend of Mrs.
Schröder's before her marriage.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ay, ay, ay! of course! how very remiss of me not to bear it in mind!
Pleasure of including your husband, Mrs. Churchill, among my distinguished
literary friends. I hope he's quite himself. Ay, ay; Miss Lexden that was, eh?
Think I've had the pleasure of meeting you, before you took rank as a matron, in
the house of my dear old friend Sir Marmaduke Wentworth? Ah! I thought so. Ill
now, poor dear fellow,--ill in the Pyrenees; hum, ha! And no cause for any
special excitement in the present lamentable case, you say, my dear Mrs.
Churchill?--hum! Well, well; death from natural causes, of course. I can testify
as to his heart-disease. Still, I'm afraid, my dear madam, there'll have to be a
horrible--what we call a <i>post-mortem</i>. The ridiculous laws of this country
are not satisfied with a professional man's word in such cases, and though--of
course I'll take care there's no annoyance. Bad thing for Mrs. Schröder,--very!
I'll go up and see her directly. By the way, my dear Mrs. Churchill,&quot; added the
little doctor, edging himself very close to Barbara, and looking more than ever
like an owl; &quot;here's a paper which I picked off the floor of the library when I
went in to see our poor late friend just now. I haven't looked at it myself, of
course; but perhaps it might be well to put it away, and not to let Mrs.
Schröder see it just yet; and,&quot; continued the doctor, examining with great
attention the pattern of the Turkey carpet, &quot;I don't see that there's any
necessity to mention its existence before the coroner's people,--no one else
seems to have seen it,--and these things are better kept quiet;&quot; and the doctor
handed Barbara a folded paper, which she at once placed in her pocket, and bowed
himself out.</p>
<p>Then there fell upon that house confusion, and silence, and sadness, and a
general mistiness and ignorance. No one spoke above their breath; no one knew
what day of the month it was, or what day of the week, or what length of time
had elapsed since the occurrence of the event which had given rise to this state
of affairs. All normal laws were suspended; the <i>carte</i> for the proposed
dinner did not go up as usual in the morning; the great butler suspended his
customary inspection of the plate and reviews of the china and glass; the young
lady really born in Picardy, but passing current as a Parisian, who was called
&quot;Mumzell&quot; by the other servants, and who was attached as special retainer to
Mrs. Schröder, had no interviews with her lady on toilet subjects, and found her
health undoubtedly improved by being relieved from mental anxiety on the subject
of the perpetual invention of new styles of head-dress. The tradesmen seemed to
take Mr. Schröder's dying out of the season as a kind of personal affront. Had
it happened when every thing was in full swing, the poulterer had remarked, and
when parties had the greatest worrit in supplying what parties ordered, why
parties might have been glad of a lull; but now, in the slack time of year, when
there was few families in town, and what was mostly supplied with game from
friends as had shooting, to have a large and reg'lar customer's orders suddenly
stopped, as might be said, in this way, was not what parties expected and might
be said to look for. Perhaps the retainers attached to the stable-department
took the pleasantest view of matters. It were a bad business, they allowed; but,
after all, there muss be money left, and the establishment wouldn't be broke up;
and besides, a missis were easier to serve than a master, and couldn't pry; not
that any thing of that sort could be said of their late guv'nor, for a more
innocenter man never breathed. He were a bad whip, always a tuggin' at the
'orses' mouths; but a good master. Meanwhile 'orses must be kep' exercised; and
so Mrs. Edwards the coachman's wife, and Nancy and Billy her young 'uns, and
Susan Gilbert, what was keeping company with Strapper the under-coachman, and
one or two convivial friends, had two or three very pleasant days at Richmond
and Hampton, proceeding thither in what they called a &quot;weggynet,&quot; borrowed from
the corn-chandler at the corner of the mews, and drawn now by the chestnuts
which Mr. Schröder used to spin along in his mail-phaeton, now by the iron-grays
which concentrated attention on Mrs. Schröder's equipage in the ring. And in
every department of the servants' hall and in the outlying regions connected
therewith, there seemed to be an impression of the over-weening necessity for
going in for good eating and drinking, as if to counteract the baleful effect of
the calamity which had occurred. In the house itself, the kitchen-maid, relieved
from attendance in that dread library, gave herself up to the cooking of mighty
joints for discussion at the &quot;one-o'clock dinner.&quot; The housekeeper and the great
butler had little refections, washed down with brown sherry, in the still-room;
while one of the two-gallon stone jars of brown brandy,--originally ordered for
preserve-purposes, and of a very different quality from the eau-de-vie-de-cognac
in the tapering bottles--was apportioned by the butler to the nightly grog of
the servants' hall. Then it was that Rawbert, one of the six-foot Johns, and son
of an Oxford scout, first showed his remarkable talent for brewing punch; under
the influence of which the assemblage grew so jolly, that some of them were only
restrained from breaking into harmony by the representation of others as to what
was lying upstairs.</p>
<p>What was lying upstairs had been moved from the library to a spare bedroom,
had been handed over to the charge of such horrible ghoulish women as only
appear at such dread times, and had been left all placid and composed and cold
and statuesque by itself. What was lying upstairs had had visitors. The
coroner--a fat man with a red face, smeared black clothes, beady black eyes, and
boots slit here and there as a necessary accommodation for gout--had visited it;
had stood at the head of the bed where it lay, and had it not been for thick
carpeting and double doors, would have sent his opinion of it clanging to the
ears of her whom it once cherished as its own heart's blood. The jury had
visited it (some of them at least, nearly half were too frightened to come
beyond the bedroom-door), and had said, &quot;Oh!&quot; and &quot;Deary me!&quot; and had looked at
the coroner and gone away again to the Coburg Arms; and then and there, over hot
brandy-and-water, administered as a corrective, and strongly recommended by the
coroner, had found a verdict of &quot;Death from natural causes.&quot; Then it had other
visitors--men in black, who took off their coats at the door and left their
boots outside, putting on list slippers, and who had foot-rules, and who
whistled to themselves softly as they went about their ghastly work. These men
came again at night with others, blundering up the stairs under the weight of a
horrible burden, and the room assumed a different aspect, and what lay therein
seemed further removed from humanity and less kin to any thing it had hitherto
claimed kinship with. And after that, it had yet another visitor; a white-robed
woman, who stole in at night and knelt at the side of its black prison-house,
and implored pardon for past waywardness and thoughtlessness and girlish
follies, and prayed for strength and succour and support; then rising, pressed
her lips on its cold forehead, and was led from the room in a half-hysterical
state.</p>
<p>Yes; Alice Schröder had begun to wake to the realities of life, to find that
opera-boxes and drums and sealskin cloaks and equipages and money, all good
things in their way, were powerless against Death; and that Death was not merely
the bugbear which he had been always painted, but had other qualities horrific
in their nature, which she at least had never imputed to him. He was a
thought-compeller, and up to that time little Alice had never known what
thinking was. But now she thought long and earnestly. She thought of her earlier
days, long before she had received her father's orders as to her marriage; she
thought of her school-girl flirtations and hopes and fears and intentions as to
matrimony; recalling the cavalry cornet, the light-whiskered curate, and the
Italian singing-master vividly in her memory. Then she had a vague recollection
of her coming-out and her town-life, through all which there loomed a shadowy
presentment of Captain Lyster, standing specially boldly out in her remembrance
of her stay at Bissett Grange; and than came Mr. Townshend's imperative
decision, and her acceptance of her dead husband's offer. Had she behaved well
to that dead husband, who had behaved so kindly to her? Ah, how painfully, as
though with an actual sting, came back the recollection of his kindness, of his
lavish generosity; how with clumsy action and ill-chosen words, but showing in
the highest degree the warmth of his affection and the delicacy of his mind, he
had loaded her with gifts, and had endeavoured to forestall her every wish! How,
with an evident straggle,--for had he not been matured to it from his youth
up?--yet successfully, he had weaned himself from the cares of business (at one
time his greatest pleasure), and learnt a new life in the society of his wife,
and in manifesting his devotion to her. Had she brought him such wealth of
affection as he had showered upon her? Had she even met him half-way? When she
was a girl, she was fond of being considered &quot;highly romantic&quot; by her
companions; she thought herself the essence of romance; and yet what was her
romance compared to that shown by that elderly gray-headed German merchant, who
had changed the whole tenor of his life for a woman's love? And had he possessed
that love? that was the bitterest question of all. Respect, yes; honour, yes;
but did she respect Mr. Beresford,--she certainly did not honour him,--who had
so often been her companion during her husband's lifetime? had she not had a
warmer feeling towards that accomplished cavalier? had she not permitted him to
speak in somewhat slighting terms, to which she by her silence had given tacit
approval of the dead man; ridiculing his age and habits, unfitting him for
finding favour in ladies' eyes, and protesting against the hard fate which cast
such pearls before such swine? All this came up clear and fresh in Alice
Schröder's memory; and as it rose she hated Beresford with all her strength;
and, struck with deepest remorse, wished--oh, how she wished!--that the time
would come over again, that she might dower her husband with her love, and show
how she appreciated his devotion to her.</p>
<p>Then what was lying there lay no longer. There came a morning when the boys
in the neighbouring mews, who had been on the look-out for some little time,
passed the word to each other that it was all right for that day, and forthwith
coming trooping out, took up their positions in available spots close by. The
mutes in their preposterous scarves, and bearing their hideous banners, mounted
guard at the door; and the hearse and the mourning-coaches pulled-up close by;
and the red-nosed men got ready the trays of feathers, and the long staves, and
the velvet trappings, and all the funeral insignia, which would be ridiculous
were they not disgusting. And the company arrived at the house: there were two
of the dead man's brothers, representing the firm respectively in Hamburg and
Paris; uncles and cousins, pillars of the London Exchange; the clerk from the
office, who had acted as the dead man's private secretary, and who was a very
presentable young man, the delight of the evening-party-givers of Surbiton; Mr.
M'quiddit from Bedford Row, who was met on the door-step by his clerk, who
presented him with an oblong packet, which the lawyer deposited in the library
before joining the rest of the company; and little Dr. Prater, looking
preternaturally solemn and wise,--all these gathered together to see Gustav
Schröder to his grave. On the dining-room table were cold fowls (already cut up,
and tied together with pieces of black crape) and cold viands; but save Mr.
M'Quiddit, who had come up from his country-house at Datchet and was hungry, no
one tasted food. The decanters, however, were put into requisition; and the
great butler took occasion to whisper in Dr. Prater's ear a recommendation of
some Vino di Pasta as being something special. Then came that most horrid time
of all, when there was a bumping and a scuffling on the stairs, and a creaking
of the bannisters. Every body knew what caused it and what it meant; and there
was an involuntary silence which made the talk, when they began again to talk,
seem more hollow and forced than it had been before. Then, draped in bilk
scarves, and wearing hats swaddled in crape, the mourners ascended the coaches,
walking to them through a lane of boys, and were borne off to Kensal Green; on
alighting at the gates of which dismal necropolis, they were marshalled into
proper order by the head undertaker, and so marched in procession to the grave.
There a gentleman, who really could not be complained of when it was remembered
that he had done duty four times already that day, and expected to do it three
times again, half drawled, half cantered through the most beautiful service of
the Church, that for the burial of the dead, without the smallest atom of
expression, and apparently without knowing what he was about; then he shut his
book, and the bystanders one by one looked into the grave--and all was over. The
mourning-coaches, which had come so slowly, went merrily back; the Schröders
went to the City house, and sent telegrams and read share-lists, and talked of
how soon Gustav's share in the concern ought to be realised; the uncles and
cousins did much the same; the presentable clerk had a holiday, and met a few
lady friends at the Zoological Gardens; Dr. Prater lunched at a rich patient's,
where he told the story of Mr. Schröder's death, and dined at another rich
patient's where he told it again; and Mr. M'Quiddit had an interview with the
widow and gave her a short abstract of the will, which was eminently
satisfactory.</p>
<br>
<p>It had been proposed by the deceased gentlemen's brothers, who were his
executors, that the widow should leave town for a few weeks,--should run down to
Brighton or Tunbridge Wells,--and thus, in change of scene, shake off the excess
of grief under which they found her to be really labouring. But under a strange
state of feeling which is scarcely describable, but which originated in an idea
that her determination to do her duty to the utmost would not be properly
carried out, were she to allow herself any thing like indulgence, poor little
Alice decided upon stopping in Saxe-Coburg Square and thenceforward entering
upon the useful state of life which she had proposed to herself. Perhaps in this
decision she was a little guided by her feeling for Barbara: the regard which
had always existed between them (regard on Barbara's side mingled with a sense
of superiority leading to pity, the regard which a grand Scotch deerhound might
feel for a little thin-limbed Italian greyhound pet) had very much increased
since the recent calamity. Alice had experienced a sisterly tenderness at
Barbara's hands which she had never thought Barbara capable of feeling; Barbara
had seen in Alice a fixed propriety of purpose such as she had never given Alice
credit for. And Alice was by no means so selfish or so thoroughly wrapped up in
her own grief as not to see that, although Barbara pretended to look upon her
own married career as entirely at an end, yet in reality she had by no means
given up all hope of a happy reconciliation with Frank. A sudden peal at the
bell would make her cheek flame; her nervousness at the sight of Pilkington
entering the room with letters was unmistakable; and in a thousand other ways
she gave evidence of he heart's yearnings. So Alice felt that while this
unsettled state of affairs lasted, Barbara's home must be with her, and that a
removal from town would be highly antagonistic to any chance of a settlement
which might transpire; and as this entirely coincided with her own views, she
elected to remain in town.</p>
<p>Mr. Schröder's will had been made a few months before his death, and was in
accordance with the general tenor of his married life. It ordered that his share
in the City firm should be realised at the earliest favourable opportunity, and
that it and all his other investments should be lodged in the name of trustees
for his wife's use and disposal. As this represented a very large annual income,
and as the details of the will soon became public through the medium of the
press, the &quot;kind-inquiries&quot; cards began to shower down in Saxe-Coburg Square.
You, who are rich, find these amicable condolences sent in at once, in such
times. You, who are poor, know that in general there is a little hanging fire
until it is understood what will be the future position of the family. In the
present day the vast proportion of middle-class people occupy a factitious
position in society; factitious, that is to say, thus far--that its existence
depends entirely on the life of the father, husband, breadwinner. So long as his
good income is made, so good; but when he dies, despite all his attempts at
laying-by, his precautions in insuring his life, the whole thing changes; all
the little luxuries have to be given up, and the family sinks into a decidedly
lower circle of society. That is why the great law-giver Society waits to hear
the will read before he nods approval on visits of condolence being paid. In
this case there could be not much doubt about money; but there were some
peculiar features,--&quot;a sudden death, my dear, and that sort of thing;&quot; and it
was thought better by Mrs. Grundy, and her set, to wait a little, until there
could be no possible doubt on the matter: After a little time, the intimates of
the house were admitted. Old Mr. Townshend was still away on the Continent; and
there never seemed to have been any other member of the Townshend family; but
the Schröders came down in flocks. The wives of the brothers, and the sisters,
and the daughters' nieces, and cousins twice removed,--who so kind as they in
time of trouble? Their husbands and fathers might be money-grubbers in the City
of London; in them was nothing but the good old German spirit of kindness, of
brotherhood and sisterhood, of honest help and openhanded affection, which had
first flourished when they were all poor stragglers in the Frankfort Judengasse,
which had lasted until they were among the most opulent of the earth. And Dr.
Prater was there, of course, every day, chirrupping softly about the house, and
going from thence up and down and into the ends of the London world, and talking
of the enormous wealth left by his poor deceased friend Mr. Schröder to his
interesting patient Mrs. Schröder. And Captain Lyster came, sending up his card,
and proffering his services in any manner in which they might be required; and
then Barbara saw him; and after a little time Alice saw him; and his services
were brought into requisition, and proved to be eminently useful. For when Fred
Lyster chose to shake off his drawl, and to apply himself, there were few men
with a quicker or a keener appreciation of what ought to be; and in settling
affairs, there were numerous cases arose in which a lady could not possibly
interfere, and in which the intervention of some one prompt, clear-headed, and
business-like, was indispensable. And as Fred Lyster had never any thing to do,
he had full leisure to attend to these matters, and entered into them with an
eagerness and a perseverance which astonished all who saw him--save Barbara, who
perhaps might have made a shrewd guess as to the mainspring of his actions. Poor
George Pringle had called too. He had been a good deal cut up by the death of
Mr. Schröder, whom he had been accustomed to describe as &quot;a good old cock, sir;
a worthy old party; kind-hearted and all that, and giving no end good feeds;&quot;
and he had, in his rough way, great sympathy for his cousin Alice,--&quot;a poor
little thing, sir; left alone, with nothing to console her.&quot;</p>
<p>With consolation-end in view, Mr. Pringle arrived one Sunday afternoon at the
door of the house in Saxe-Coburg Square, in a hansom cab, whence he extracted a
smooth English white terrier, with a black patch over one eye. Taking this
animal under his arm, he, after making due inquiries after Mrs. Schröder's
health, transferred it to the frightened grasp of Pilkington, requesting that it
might be at once carried upstairs with his love. Pilkington was horribly
frightened,--he &quot;never could abide dawgs;&quot; and so no sooner was the door closed
than he set the animal down in the hall, where, catching sight of the well-fed
calves of Rawbert the footman, it presently began to lick its lips, and growled
in a very ominous manner.</p>
<p>Mr. Beresford called three times: once immediately after the announcement of
the death, when he simply left his card; once on the day after the funeral,
when, besides his card, he left a warm message of inquiry; once a fortnight
after, when &quot;he hoped he might be permitted to see Mrs. Schröder.&quot; Barbara was
with Alice in her boudoir when this message arrived; and she noticed that the
poor little woman went deadly white as she listened, and then flushed deeply.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, no, no!&quot; she exclaimed; &quot;I cannot see him. Barbara darling, I never will
see him again. I hate the mention of his name; it jars upon me now; I cannot
tell you how--oh, no, no!&quot; And so Barbara framed a polite reply in Alice's name,
and Mr. Beresford went away.</p>
<p>That night, as Barbara sat in her own room, feeling very weary and worn, and
with an irrepressible yearning towards her husband and her home, the tears rose
in her eyes; and, determined not to indulge in the luxury of &quot;a good cry,&quot; she
drew out her handkerchief, and with it a paper, which fell to the ground at her
feet. Looking down at it as it lay there, she recognised the paper which had
been found in the library, and handed to her by Dr. Prater, on the night of Mr.
Schröder's death, and which had ever since entirely escaped her recollection.
She picked it up from the carpet, and opened it; but no sooner had her eyes
fallen on the inside than she gave a start of astonishment, and uttered a low
cry. The same!--unquestionably the same handwriting! The circumstances connected
with both previous occasions of her having seen it far too deeply impressed it
on her mind to allow of her being mistaken. It was that long scrawly
handwriting--unmistakably that of a woman only partially educated--in which the
letters to Frank Churchill--that delivered at Bissett, and the envelope found in
the dressing-room--had both been addressed. If Barbara's heart beat fast when
her eyes first fell upon the lines, how much more disturbed was she when she
read their contents, as follows:</p>
<br>
<p>&quot;Your wife is false to you, and is carrying on with a Mr. Beresford. They
meet every day, ride together, and deceive you. Watch them, and you will find
this out. It has been going on for some time--for months. It is a thing that
Beresford has meant for a long time; and he always carries out what he means. I
know him well.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 60%">&quot;<span class="sc">A Friend</span>.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p>It was, then, the receipt of this letter which had had such fatal effect on
poor Mr. Schröder. He had fallen, pierced to the heart by this anonymous stab.
Any excitement, any worry, or anxiety, coming suddenly on him, might have ended
his life at any time, Dr. Prater had said; and so--Dr. Prater? It was he who had
picked up this paper from the library-floor, on to which it had fallen from the
dead man's hand. The doctor had asked her whether there had been any cause for
sudden excitement; had suggested that the paper should not be shown to Mrs.
Schröder; that its existence need not be mentioned before the coroner. He had
read it, then. Barbara had no need to think twice to assure herself on that
point. That the imputations on Alice which the anonymous letter conveyed were
unfounded, Barbara had not the smallest doubt. She knew that her friend, though
thoughtless, had never, even in thought, been guilty; and knew that she now
bitterly repented her levity and silliness. It would be worse than cruel to let
her know of the existence of this document; it must be kept from her at all
hazards. Alice's horror of Mr. Beresford was now so great as to require no
fanning; and Barbara was certain that of her own free will the widow would never
see him again. But in the event of Mr. Beresford's demanding an interview, what
was to be done then? Poor Barbara found it impossible to answer this
self-proposed question; and there was no one to whom she could apply for advice.
Captain Lyster had been her mainstay in several cases; but this was a delicate
matter, which it was impossible to make him acquainted with. Oh, if she only had
Frank to turn to! and that sent her thoughts reverting to the handwriting. Whose
could it be?--who could be the owner of that fatal <i>griffe</i>, which seemed
to bring desolation with it wherever it arrived? And at the end of her reverie,
finding herself no clearer in her suspicions than she was at first, Barbara
locked the note into her desk, and determined to leave to chance the use she
might eventually make of it.</p>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_34" href="#div1Ref_34">CHAPTER XXXIV.</a></h4>
<h5>ET TU BRUTE!</h5>
<br>
<p>On the morning succeeding the day on which Mr. Schröder died, Mr. Simnel sat
in his room in the Tin-Tax Office, deep in a reverie. The newspaper lay on the
floor at his feet; he was slowly rubbing the knee from which it had just fallen,
and his other hand supported his chin. The news had come upon him suddenly; and
he was calmly thinking to what results the occurrence might tend. Had he been at
his club the night before, he would have heard the whisper which, thanks to Dr.
Prater, was then permeating the West End; but on his return from Kate Mellon's,
Mr. Simnel had quietly dined in his own rooms, and there remained for the rest
of the evening, arranging his plans. Thus the first intimation which he had
received of the event was from the columns of the newspaper then lying at his
feet; in which a paragraph headed &quot;Sudden death of a City-merchant&quot; had speedily
claimed his attention. Matters of weighty importance had Mr. Simnel to filter
through his mind in the course of that reverie. He was a worldly-minded man, but
by no means a bad man at heart; and the fact of the rich man's death at that
particular time struck him as specially touching and softening. The newspaper
described the anguish of the dead man's widow as &quot;inexpressible;&quot; and though
Simnel, from his experience, was not inclined to lay much stress on the
exactness of that statement, yet he felt that in all probability the little
woman of whom he had heard so much, would probably be very much distressed. From
all he had learned, he believed that of late the relations between her and her
husband had been very much deepened and strengthened. He guessed somewhat of
this from the fact that Beresford had been more than infrequent and shy in his
allusions to that <i>ménage</i>, and to the pursuit he was engaged in in that
quarter. Beresford? By Jove! then his chance was come much sooner than either of
them had anticipated! the great obstacle was removed, and he had the course
clear before him. No, not exactly clear; the manner of her husband's death, the
suddenness of it, would create a great revulsion in Mrs. Schröder's mind, and
greatly imperil Mr. Beresford's chances, however strong they might be. Whether
they were strong or not was a matter of doubt in Mr. Simnel's mind; he had a
great contempt for Beresford's word, knowing him to be possessed of a happy
inability to speak truth; and sometimes he doubted whether his colleague had
really made any play worth mentioning at the house in Saxe-Coburg Square. Then
Mr. Simnel began rubbing his knee more violently than ever, as he thought that
the whole affair from first to last was very disreputable, and one which
redounded to the credit of no one engaged in it. Would it not be better to drop
Mr. Beresford altogether, and leave him to fight his own way in the matter? It
certainly would be more honourable and satisfactory in every way; but then--why
then, if Mr. Beresford did not marry some rich woman (and Mrs. Schröder was his
best chance), he would go to the dogs; and then what would become of his,
Simnel's, eight hundred and twenty five pounds? Worse still, if Beresford did
not succeed with Mrs. Schröder, he might suddenly veer round, and on the impulse
of the moment, and under the pressure of creditors, go up and declare for Kate
Mellon's hand. And Simnel was by no means certain that that young woman would
decline such an offer, even after all that had occurred; on the contrary, being
naturally suspicious, and on the present occasion jealous and in love, the
thought sent such a twinge through him, that he shrugged his shoulders, and made
up his mind that things must take their course.</p>
<p>As he sat there, rubbing his leg much more calmly after arriving at this
determination, the door opened, and Mr. Beresford entered the room. He nodded
airily, and, pointing to the newspaper on the floor, said, &quot;You've seen it, of
course? That chattering doctor-fellow was right, you see. What do you think of
it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of it? of what? of Mr. Schröder's death, do you mean? I think it a very sad
thing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The devil you do!&quot; said Mr. Beresford with a sneering laugh; &quot;the door's
shut, Simnel; don't you think you'd better drop that innocence when you and I
tire alone together?&quot;</p>
<p>He was a cur, this man, and instinctively a cad; he had been as miserable as
possible for weeks; but he thought he saw the breaking-up of the dark clouds
now, and immediately began to swagger and hector on the strength of it.</p>
<p>&quot;Be good enough to understand, Mr. Beresford, that that is language which I
don't permit <i>any body</i> to use to me!&quot; said Simnel, through his shut teeth,
and with a very white face; &quot;I repeat that I think Mr. Schröder's death a very
sad thing. Why do you choose to sneer when I say so?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, no, not sneer: hang it, old fellow! you take one up so infernally sharp.
Bad thing, of course it is, for him, poor devil; but good thing for me; and as
you know rather more of me than you did of him, I fancied I should have had your
congratulations.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I see,&quot; said Simnel; &quot;you fancy you ought to have received my
congratulations: on what, may I ask?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Look here, Simnel!&quot; said Beresford, turning savagely round; &quot;drop this
infernal nonsense; it doesn't do here, and it's ill-timed. Don't come the <i>
non-mi-ricorde</i> business, after having been arch-conspirator and suggested
every thing. Plainly, the death of this unfortunate man is in my favour, because
he was the principal obstacle in my way to the success of our scheme; and he is
removed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well; looking at it in that way--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In that way! in what other way would you look at it? It's in a remarkably <i>
£ s.d</i>. kind of way that it presents itself to me, I can tell you. I don't
mind mentioning now, Simnel, what I shouldn't have let on otherwise; that I'm
tremendously dipped; in for--ay, I daresay, three thousand more than you know
any thing about; and here's the chance come just in the nick of time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where did you get in for this? and where did you get the money?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Get in for it? Doncaster, the Cæsarewitch, the Cambridgeshire! each infernal
thing went to the bad. I stood a cracker on the first; then tried a pull through
with the other two; and was all wrong with the lot. Scadgers, Parkinson, and a
new man, Barnett, of Stamford Street, over the water, did the advances; but I
should have looked very blue, if this hadn't come off, I can tell you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're a little sanguine, are you not? It <i>hasn't</i> come off yet, has
it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What a wet blanket you are, Simnel! No, of course not. Indeed there's been a
strong element of virtue and duty, and all that sort of thing, introduced of
late. But now there's no necessity for that. The actual fancy and liking always
existed, I flatter myself; and now all that can be indulged in without the
slightest suspicion of vice.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To be sure, to be sure,&quot; muttered Mr. Simnel, ruminating; &quot;you'll have to
proceed very cautiously; but that you'll of course understand.&quot; Mr. Beresford,
by this time half way to the door, nodded his head and went out.</p>
<p>Some few days afterwards Mr. Simnel was again honoured by a visit in his room
from the Commissioner. The latter gentleman looked worn and tired; he threw
himself into a chair and began beating his boot with his cane, and seemed
altogether out of sorts. Mr. Simnel noticed all this, and was tolerably prepared
for what was coming. &quot;What's the matter, sir?&quot; he asked quietly; &quot;have you had
too many papers to sign; or are you annoyed at having to come down to this
plebeian part of the town so early as two o'clock; or haven't you had your
lunch; or what is it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't chaff Simnel; I'm not in the humour for chaff just now. I'm afraid I'm
getting into a hole at last.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What's the matter now?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, these infernal fellows are putting on the screw--lawyer's letters,
writs, and all that rascally machinery; and I don't see a chance of staving them
off. If I could have said any thing about a rich marriage now--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's exactly what I was coming to. How about Saxe-Coburg Square?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, fishy, very fishy. I've called there three times; the last time
sending in specially and particularly to say that I wanted to speak to her; and
still the same answer--compliments--not kind regards, you know--compliments, and
utterly unable to see me. No hint of a future opportunity--nothing!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That looks badly, certainly. What do you intend to do?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do! Go there again. Have it out by hook or by crook. By Jove, I will see
her! I'll remind her that--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Doesn't this strike you as devilish low behaviour? Don't you see that to
thrust yourself in where you are evidently not wanted, to break in upon the
privacy of a lady, who is in the beginning of her first great sorrow--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, drop that, please. Doesn't it strike you that I owe you nearly nine
hundred pounds, and other people a great deal more; and that if they're not
paid, I shall be arrested and sold up? And don't you see, therefore, that I <i>
must</i>--No, by Jove! I don't see why I should; you're quite right; it is an
ungentlemanly business, and I'm sick of all this dodging and duffing and forcing
myself down the throat of a woman whose liking for me seems to have gone off.
But there's one who would still seem to care about me, Simnel, my boy, I'll
wager any money; and one whom I've been a fool not to think of before--Kate
Mellon!&quot;</p>
<p>385</p>
<p>&quot;Kate Mellon?&quot; echoed Mr. Simnel with scowling brows.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Kate Mellon! She's got ready-money enough to pay off all my ticks and
set me square; and then I could keep square. I'm sure she'd forget all that
stupid business of which I told you; though I've never seen her since. I could
put that right in a minute; and--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think it would do,&quot; said Mr. Simnel earnestly--&quot;I don't think it
would do. Miss Mellon's status in society would be fatal to all your hopes of
advancement. Your aunt Lady Lowndes and the bishop would cut you dead; and
remember,&quot; added he, after a pause, and with an attempt at a smile, very ghastly
and gummy and forced, &quot;I am interested in this matter to the extent of eight
hundred pounds, and I don't think it would do. I'm disposed to recommend you to
hold to the other, which appears to me to want only a little patience, and--if I
understand from you the security of your position--an undoubted declaration to
bring to a favourable issue.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And what would you advise?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A letter. I will draft you what I should suggest; and if you approve, you
can copy it, or embody it in any thing else you have to say to Mrs. Schröder;&quot;
and Mr. Simnel sat down at once at his desk and began to write. Mr. Beresford
sat watching him the while. Not a change in Simnel's face, not an inflexion of
his voice, had escaped him; and he wondered what it all meant, and in what Kate
Mellon's fortunes could have influence over the impassible secretary of the
Tin-Tax Office.</p>
<br>
<p>Two days after this interview, Mr. Beresford called in Saxe-Coburg Square and
sent up his card, requesting an interview with Mrs. Schröder. The usual message
of excuse being returned to him, he gave the servant a letter which he had
brought with him, and begged that the man would take it to his mistress; he
would await the answer. Mrs. Schröder, seated in her boudoir, read the note,
seemed greatly disturbed, told the man that she would send an answer downstairs
by her maid, and immediately rushed off to the adjacent bedroom, where Barbara
Churchill was lamenting all that had happened, and wondering what was to be the
end of her life.</p>
<p>&quot;O Barbara, Barbara darling, what shall I do?&quot; exclaimed the poor little
woman; &quot;here is Mr. Beresford come again, and he wanted to see me, and I said
no, as we had determined, and then he sent me up this dreadful letter! Oh, what
shall I say to him, dear? oh, do help me, there's a darling.&quot;</p>
<p>Barbara took the letter from Alice's shaking hand and read it. It was not a
pleasing composition; it began in an injured tone, and then grew mysterious, and
then almost threatening. The writer demanded an interview, and justified his
demand by referring to certain bygone circumstances which the reader would
readily remember; and the whole tone was sentimentally prurient and offensive
and objectionable in the highest degree. Poor little Alice had not seen any
thing of this kind in it; she had merely found it &quot;horrid&quot; and &quot;impertinent;&quot;
but Barbara's cheek flamed as she perused it, and the tone of her voice was
rather sharp as she said, &quot;Is the man still here, Alice?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What man, dear? Mr. Beresford?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course!--is there any other? Oh, he is here. Very well, then, leave me
this letter, and I will go down and speak to him about it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You'll see him, Barbara?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Barbara, who was already opening her desk and looking for
something therein. &quot;It will be the best way. You'll find he won't trouble you
any more.&quot; She kissed Alice at the door, and walking down stairs and into the
drawing-room, confronted Mr. Beresford.</p>
<p>That gentleman was seated near the window with book of photographs, at which
he was not looking, in his hand. He rose as he heard the door open, and advanced
rapidly when he saw the female figure: the room was somewhat darkened by heavy
curtains, and he could not clearly make out who it was. When Barbara, stopping,
pulled herself to her fall height, he stopped, too, disappointed; he expected
some one far less majestic.</p>
<p>&quot;You wished to see Mrs. Schröder, I believe, Mr. Beresford,&quot; said Barbara,
after the first salutation: &quot;I come as her representative.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am very sensible of the honour you do me, Mrs. Churchill,&quot; replied
Beresford; &quot;but I fear that no representative will do. I want to speak to Mrs.
Schröder herself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That is impossible,&quot; said Barbara, calmly.</p>
<p>&quot;Impossible is a very strong word, Mrs. Churchill. I sent Mrs. Schröder a
letter--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, yes, here it is; it is about this letter that I have come to you. You'll
sit, Mr. Beresford, please; for this is likely to be a prolonged talk. Now you
know that I am Mrs. Schröder's oldest and most intimate friend, and as such I am
deputed to answer this letter.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pardon me, I have no grounds for believing the latter part--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Except my word; and you won't doubt that? No! I thought not! Now, Mr.
Beresford, I am about to speak very plainly to you, always relying on you as a
gentleman. Mrs. Schröder is very young, and rather thoughtless and not too much
gifted with brains. Since you have been acquainted with her, both before and
after marriage, you have paid her small attentions, such as no woman dislikes.
They were attentions such as the rigidly-censorious might shake their heads at;
but which no woman, knowing her own rectitude and conscious of the proper
understanding existing between her husband and herself, need have been afraid
of. But the case is altered now! Poor Alice is unfortunately in the position of
having no husband as her guide and safeguard, and--these attentions must cease!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You speak as Mrs. Schröder's mouthpiece, Mrs. Churchill?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Precisely! In this letter which I have here, there is a tone which I am sure
you did not intend to convey; but about which it is my duty to speak to you
plainly. Under present circumstances Mrs. Schröder feels it necessary to limit
her knowledge of you to that of the merest acquaintance. There is no other
footing on which you can know each other. If you were not what I know you to be,
a gentleman, I should point out that there is not, nor ever has been, any thing
between you which could lead you to any other supposition--no letters, no any
thing which ill-natured persons could lay hold of--you follow me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ye-es, ye-es!&quot; said Beresford, feeling that he was outwitted.</p>
<p>&quot;That is right--so, as you are a gentleman, I don't mind telling you the
urgent necessity for the adoption of this course. Notwithstanding the absence of
any such evidence as I have spoken of, the world has chosen to talk.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, ah!&quot; said Mr. Beresford, with a smile of returning satisfaction.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, in its usual base and unfounded manner. Here is an anonymous letter
which was addressed to the late Mr. Schröder.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Let me look at it!&quot; said Beresford, eagerly.</p>
<p>&quot;It is here;&quot; and Barbara handed to him the paper picked off the
library-floor by Dr. Prater.</p>
<p>Mr. Beresford took the letter from her hand. The instant his eye fell on the
handwriting, Barbara, who was looking at him steadfastly, saw his colour change
and his hand shake. But he read it through without saying a word, and returned
it to her with a bow.</p>
<p>&quot;You will see now, Mr. Beresford, the utter impossibility of Mrs. Schröder's
permitting her acquaintance with you to continue,&quot; said Barbara. &quot;You will see
that the note which you addressed to her can have no answer but that which I
have already given you; and that henceforth, as a gentleman, you are bound in
honour not to--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course! of course!&quot; replied Beresford; &quot;it is of the other letter I am
thinking now.&quot; And he set his teeth and struck his ungloved hand violently with
his cane. &quot;You have introduced a new element into the discussion, Mrs.
Churchill, and you must pardon me if I close it here. What my future course may
be, circumstances must determine: I make no promise, as I make no threats;
but--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We will close the discussion at once, sir, if you please!&quot; said Barbara,
haughtily.</p>
<p>&quot;At once,&quot; said Beresford, with a bow. &quot;Believe me that the advocacy of that
anonymous person--whose handwriting I recognise--though useful perhaps, as time
may prove--is by no means flattering.&quot;</p>
<p>He bowed again and left the room. &quot;By no means flattering!&quot; echoed Barbara
after he had gone; &quot;it is, then, as I suspected, some horrible wretch who has
east this shadow over my life!&quot;</p>

<h5>BALTHAZAR.</h5>
<br>
<p>Mr. Simnel sat calmly over his breakfast in his rooms in Piccadilly, little
dreaming of all that had occurred on the previous day in Saxe-Coburg Square. He
skimmed the newspaper; he dallied with his toast; he laid down his knife and
fork and paused in his meal, smiling to himself with the air of a man who had
reason for self-gratulation. Such reason had Mr. Simnel. He had fought a very
long and arduous and up-hill fight--a fight in which the odds were all against
him, and which he had won entirely by patience and excellent generalship. And
now the difficulties were surmounted; the land lay straight before him; and he
was just about to clutch the prize which, with so much trouble, he had won. &quot;You
shall have it, Robert!&quot; those were the last words which she had said to him;
words which haunted his memory, which he found himself repeating over and aver
again. The woman he had loved so long and so quietly, who at one time appeared
far beyond the power of his grasp, had succumbed; he had won her honestly, and
by his own tact and perseverance; and she would be his own! There would be a bar
sinister in her escutcheon, but what of that? Against herself, against the
propriety of her conduct, no one had ever dared to drop a hint. Her father
should make such a settlement on her as, coupled with his own money, would
relieve her from the necessity of pursuing her then occupation, of doing any
thing but play her part as mistress of her house, and enjoy herself. What a fool
was Beresford!--ah, that opened up a fresh vein of thought! He had said
yesterday that, failing in his pursuit of Mrs. Schröder, should fall back on
Kate Mellon, and try and patch up that severed alliance. Simnel's heart beat
loudly as this recurred to his mind; he knew how deep had been the attachment
which Kate had formed for Beresford, and he was not sure that she would not be
even yet willing to listen to proposals of peace. She must not have the
chance--that was what he determined; and he rang his bell hurriedly, and sat
biting his nails until it was answered.</p>
<p>&quot;You saw Mr. Scadgers?&quot; he demanded of his servant.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, sir; he will be at your office at one o'clock.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good; now go over at once to Austin Friars to Mr. Townshend's office. Tell
the head-clerk,&quot; said he, taking a telegraphic despatch from his pocket, &quot;that
his master will arrive at London Bridge at half-past one, and that he must send
some one to meet him. Say that I shall be with Mr. Townshend at three sharp. You
understand?&quot; The valet answered in the affirmative and left the room, returning
in a few minutes and ushering in Mr. Beresford. That gentleman looked any thing
but happy; his face was of a dull leaden hue, his eyes were dull and red-rimmed,
and the tell-tale muscles of his mouth were working visibly. He flung himself
into, a chair, and as soon as the door closed, said: &quot;Here's a devil of a go!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What's the matter, man?&quot; asked Simnel. &quot;Look here--you're all out of
sorts--lips going and hands shaking--just steady yourself before you speak.
Here!&quot; and he unlocked a sideboard and placed a liqueur-stand before his friend.</p>
<p>&quot;That's better!&quot; said Beresford, draining a wine-glass of brandy. &quot;I am all
wrong, and enough to make me! Thought I'd catch you here before you went down to
work. I've no end to tell you--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tell on!&quot; said Mr. Simnel; and, so encouraged, Beresford narrated every
thing that had occurred between him and Barbara the preceding day, respecting
the anonymous letter and the conversation that had ensued thereanent, word for
word.</p>
<p>As Mr. Simnel listened his heart sunk within him, and it was with the
greatest difficulty that he prevented himself from displaying his emotion. He
succeeded, however, so admirably, that though the colour of his face might have
gone a shade or two paler, not a muscle of it moved, and when Beresford stopped,
he said, without a tremor in his voice, &quot;What do you intend to do?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To do!&quot; screamed Beresford--&quot;well, upon my soul, Simnel, you are a wonderful
man! I tell you this tremendous story, which, for heartless villany, beats any
thing I ever heard--and done by a woman too!--and all you ask is, what I intend
to do! Do!--I intend to punish that she-devil, cost what it may! to--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Steady, sir! you're using strong language--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! what! Kate Mellon, I mean; not Mrs. Schröder--my mind's made up with
regard to her! I shall--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Look here, Beresford; did you come here to rave and storm before me, or to
ask my advice?--which?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know what the deuce you mean by raving and storming! You'd do the
same if you'd been treated in this way by a--there, never mind, I'll take your
advice if--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If it agrees with your own plans! generous creature! Now look here; you're
in a horrible state of rage and fever, in which you can do no good. My advice to
you is, to go away straight at once. Go out of town somewhere for a fortnight,
and then come back and see how the land lies.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And so lose every chance I've got! No, thank ye. You know all that business
yesterday was Mrs. Churchill, not Mrs. Schröder. I don't believe the widow knows
a word about that cursed letter; and there may be a chance of getting over her
yet, though that Churchill woman is as deep as the Whissendine. She and I always
hated each other, I think, and I don't intend to let her beat me now; no! I've
sent a line to Mrs. Schröder marked private, without any flummery of former
days, or any thing of that sort,--simply begging her to meet me in the Row this
afternoon and give me five minutes' talk. If she does that, I think I can put
matters square; and if not--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And if not?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, if not, by George, Simnel, up goes the sponge, and no mistake. There
are three writs out against me, and I fancy some of Sloman's people are on.
There have been some fellows hanging about my door in South Audley Street; and I
fancy, from what Stephens says, they were any thing but the right sort. What are
you thinking about?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was thinking,&quot; said Mr. Simnel slowly, &quot;that if this Schröder business
does not come off,--and I don't think it will,--you'd better send in a
certificate from Prater or some one, and get away to the Continent for six
months.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, we'll wait and see what to-day brings forth, at all events. If it
don't do, I'll very likely take your advice.&quot;</p>
<p>After Mr. Beresford had gone, Mr. Simnel sat with his feet on the fender,
slowly rubbing his knee. &quot;It must be hurried through at once,&quot; he said to
himself. &quot;I'll square the settlement to-day; and if Beresford fails with Mrs.
Schröder, he must be got out of town and abroad. Vengeance, eh? no, not quite
that, my fine fellow. Long before you come back, there'll be somebody with a
right to interfere, if any thing like vengeance is threatened.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p>And how fared it with Kate Mellon all this while? what had happened to the
pivot on which so many schemes of love and hate, of worship and revenge, were
turning? In a bad way was Kate Mellon mentally and thence physically. The news
of Mr. Schröder's death, which she had read accidentally in an &quot;odds and ends&quot;
column of a cheap sporting-paper, had come upon her with a terrific shock. She
had compared dates, and found that it had happened on the day after the despatch
of her letter; and though there was nothing to create any connexion between the
circumstances, she felt a kind of horrible impression that by her act she had
hastened his end. This preyed upon her mind; and as she had no one in whom to
confide--(had Simnel come up in the interval, it is probable that she would have
told him all, for the sake of getting a scrap of consolation, of advice--of mere
talk--so weightily did the retention of the secret lie on her),--she fretted and
worried herself, and each day grew more feverish, more unsettled, more
discontented. One horrible thought she had, which swallowed up all the
rest--might not she unconsciously have helped her rival to her happiness! If
this fair-haired woman cared for Charley, as had been stated (and as she had
seen with her own eyes), she could not have cared for her husband. He was now
removed, and there was nothing to prevent a marriage between them. Here was a
phantom which nothing could lay; a spectre which would haunt her day and night,
ever mocking and gibing at her; and she tossed in ceaseless torture, and grew
paler and thinner, and took less interest in her business every day.</p>
<p>On the day on which Mr. Beresford and Mr. Simnel had the conversation just
narrated, Kate Mellon lay on the sofa in her little drawing-room, listless and
drowsy, as was her wont nowadays, and with her head buried in her hands. She
roused herself at a loud knock at the door, and bade the person enter. It was
old Freeman, the stud-groom.</p>
<p>&quot;Here's Hockley, miss, just coom down from town staäbles. Black harse from
Ireland, 'raived last neet.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What horse, Freeman?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Waät harse, eh? Mai bairn, thee'rt gangin' daft wi' soommut; ai heeard not
waät! Waät harse? why, black harse we bought of Markis Clonmel--black hoonter
which Johnson wrote aboot last week.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ay, ay, I recollect! What does Hockley say of him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hockley says he's tearer! groom as browt him to steamer said as nowt could
hold him! I'se warrant we teach him manners!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes; I'll do that myself, and at once too! I want a little rousing. Put a
pair into the wagonette, Freeman, and drive me down to Down Street. I'll give
this horse a turn at once!&quot;</p>
<p>Besides her establishment at The Den, Kate Mellon had a set of stables near
Piccadilly, which were mainly devoted to the reception of new arrivals from the
country, and as temporary resting-places for the horses required for Rotten-Row
pupils. These stables were equally perfectly appointed with The Den; and when
the wagonette containing Kate and her head-groom drove in, she found a portion
of her staff ready to receive her.</p>
<p>&quot;What's this new Irish horse like, Tanner?&quot; said she to her town manager.</p>
<p>&quot;A bad 'un, miss; a rank bad 'un as ever stepped! Good 'oss, fine-made 'oss
jump any think; good slopin' shoulders, and henormous quarters; but the temper
of--savin' your presence--the devil! He pinned one of the men when he was
a-dressin' him this morning, and his hi rolls fearful;&quot; and Mr. Tanner, who,
though a thorough horseman, was an undeniable Cockney, led the way towards the
loose box where the new arrival was standing. &quot;They calls 'im Balthazar,&quot; said
he; &quot;and if that means a out-an'-out bad 'un, they're right.&quot;</p>
<p>They found him in a loose box at the end of the yard, a big brown-black
horse, sixteen and a half, six off, with a long lean head, deep neck, round
barrel, deep chest, low back, short forehand, big broad foot. As the door of the
box opened he turned his eye round, showing an inflamed white, put back his
ears, and lashed out savagely.</p>
<p>&quot;Hold on, mon!&quot; said old Freeman; &quot;steady, boy; let's look at thee;&quot; and the
old man went fearlessly up to the horse's head, and placing his hand in the
head-collar, commenced turning him about.</p>
<p>&quot;Send one of your men for my saddle, Tanner, and put No. 3 bridle on him. Is
No. 3 the one with the deep port? Yes, that's it,&quot; said she, touching it with
her whip. &quot;I'll just see what he's made of in the Row.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Miss,&quot; said old Freeman, coming up close to her, and whispering, &quot;better
wait till t'see waät's made of oop in tan-ride at whoom--naästy brute, I'm
thinkin' 't 'ill prove.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, never mind, Freeman; there's room in the Row to give him a very good
bucketing. Bring him out.&quot;</p>
<p>He came out with a bound, and backed and reared and kicked when any one
approached him, so that fully five minutes had elapsed before Kate, with all her
readiness and agility, found herself on his back. Once mounted he started off at
once, pelting over the uneven stones, and slipping about in a manner that made
old Freeman hold up his hands and curse the Paving Commissioners, with even more
than his usual energy.</p>
<p>Down one incline of Piccadilly and up the other went Balthazar, now and then
trying his chance of a buck-jump, occasionally manifesting his inclination to
rear. So through the Arch and into the Row. There Kate thought he might have his
fling; there was no one within sight; and &quot;to take it out&quot; of a brute like this
was a feat in which at one time she would have taken infinite pleasure; even now
it promised some excitement. So quietly drawing the curb and simultaneously
touching him with her heel, she felt the big brute give one tremendous plunge
and snort, and then dart off like lightning. And now Kate's colour came again,
and her heart leapt within her as she felt once more the ecstasy of tearing
speed. Away he goes, easy as a chair when once he has settled into his stride,
and with more real go in him than she has felt in any horse she has ridden for
months. Bravo, Balthazar! Whoop, boy! get along! and the blue habit floats
behind, and the gravel flies round her, and she is going the real pace now, and
no mistake! Who is this rider creeping out across her path from beneath the
trees? Steady, boy, steady! by Jove, he's got the bit between his teeth, and
there's no stopping him! Soho, soho, man! a shake--another; that's done it! the
bit's free, and she pulls him up easily; and to her pulling him rides up a man,
flushed, with working lips and scarlet face--Charles Beresford. She stares at
him with starting eyes and compressed lips, through which comes the word
&quot;Charley!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It <i>is</i> you, you she-devil, is it?&quot; said Beresford: &quot;I thought it must
be. This is fate that has sent you here to hear me curse you. I know what you've
done, fast enough. You thought you could stab in secret, did you, you Jezabel?
and without its being known where the blow came from! But I saw your infernal
hand, and when I saw it, I cursed you as I curse you now!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Charley! Charley! oh, for God's sake; oh, if ever you cared for me--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Cared for you! I never did! I told you so--told you at least as plainly as a
man could tell a woman; and then in sheer revenge--in dirty, low, mean
revenge--you do this; but I'll be even with you. I'll--stand off, curse you!
take your hand off, I say--&quot;</p>
<p>She had laid her hand on his arm. He shook it off roughly, and in shaking it
off raised his whip-hand spasmodically, and struck Balthazar sharply in the
mouth. The Irish horse reared up on end straight as a dart, forced to his feet,
plunged for an instant, and then started off in a mad gallop. Kate sat like a
rock, pulling--pulling without the slightest effect. Then looking down she saw
he had his eye turned back towards her, and held the bit in a firm grip between
his teeth. This time the shake was no use; he would not loose his grip, and the
bit was useless. They are nearing the end of the Row, and she remembers,
shudderingly, the heavy iron gates, between which it would be impossible to
steer him. If she could but turn him into the Drive, and so head up towards the
Serpentine bridge! A touch with her leg and a sharp tug at the rein; the Irish
horse rises like a bird at the iron bars, but touches them with his fore-feet,
and falls headlong into the Drive, rolling over on to his rider, who lies there
crushed and motionless.</p>

<h4><a name="div1_36" href="#div1Ref_36">CHAPTER XXXVI.</a></h4>
<h5>&quot;BE SURE YOUR SIN WILL FIND YOU OUT.&quot;</h5>
<br>
<p>When Mr. Scadgers walked into the lobby of the Tin-Tax Office soon after noon
on the day on which Mr. Beresford had announced to Mr. Simnel his intention of
taking some decisive step in the Schröder business, he asked to be shown to Mr.
Simnel. The abruptness and audacity of this demand struck dismay into the
breasts of the attendant messengers; they could scarcely believe their ears. Mr.
Scadgers was not unknown in the classic regions of Rutland House: in all the
various departments of that grand governmental hive he drove a roaring trade;
and though it was mostly carried on by correspondence, or through agents, yet he
occasionally appeared in person on the scene, notably on Quarter-days, for the
purpose of &quot;bouncing&quot; an instalment out of recalcitrant debtors. So, had he
inquired for any of the junior clerks, or for any recognised black sheep of
higher standing, he would have been quietly shown into the waiting-room
apportioned for the reception of the public, and a light-heeled Mercury would
have been torn from the perusal of the newspaper, and, with his tongue in his
cheek, have been started off to summon the indebted one. But when Mr. Simnel's
name was mentioned, it was quite a different thing. The head messenger, who had
never before attended to Mr. Scadgers, condescended to listen to what he had to
say, at the same time deadening any hopes which might have been entertained with
a chilling shoulder-shrug. &quot;I'll see, sir,&quot; said he,---&quot;I'll see; but I think
the Seckittary is partic'lar engaged just now: if you'll take a seat, sir, I'll
let him have your name; but--&quot; &quot;That's all; you tell him I'm here,&quot; said Mr.
Scadgers, simply; &quot;I'll stand the racket about his seeing me or not.&quot; The chief
messenger shook his head as he walked slowly towards the secretarial apartment:
he knew that no business in Mr. Scadgers's peculiar line could be on foot
between that worthy and Mr. Simnel; for did not he, the chief messenger, take
the Secretary's pass-book to the bank; did he not pay-in moneys, and get cash
for his master's cheques; and was he not consequently aware that a very capital
balance was always standing in Mr. Simnel's name? What could it be? The chief
messenger's astonishment was increased when he received his orders to show the
&quot;party of the name of Scadgers&quot; in at once to the secretarial presence; was at
its height when, bidden to send for a cab, he saw the Secretary and Mr. Scadgers
drive away together.</p>
<p>Arrived at Austin Friars, Mr. Simnel bade his companion wait in the outer
office, while he himself was shown into the sanctum. He found Mr. Townshend
somewhat aged and broken, but invested with all such relics of his former
haughtiness as he could command. He received his visitor with studied cold
politeness, pointed him to a chair, and waited for him to speak.</p>
<p>&quot;I was sorry,&quot; began Simnel, &quot;to be compelled to ask you to return home; but
the fact is that the business was urgent, and I had no alternative. You
comprehend?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I comprehend, sir,&quot; answered Mr. Townshend, &quot;that the last time I saw you
you proved yourself possessed of a secret, on the keeping of which depends
my--almost my life! The possession of this secret enables you to dictate terms
to me at your own convenience. Your convenience is now. You ordered me to come
here to hear your terms, and I am here. Isn't that so?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You put matters a little harshly, Mr. Townshend; as, when you have heard
what you are pleased to call my terms, I think you will allow. I do not come
merely to dictate terms to you, as I at one time thought I should. There are
wheels within wheels in my scheme; and I must take off the front, and show you
the whole scheme at work before you will be able to see the mechanism of it. The
last time I had the pleasure of talking with you, you asked me what I wanted; I
told you nothing. Since then I have made up my mind. I want justice!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Justice!&quot; echoed the old man, turning deadly white; &quot;justice!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Justice!&quot; said Simnel; &quot;not <i>on</i> any one though, merely <i>for</i>
somebody. Pardon my again asking about that door. Nobody to listen, eh? All
right! Last time I was here I had a notion in my head, which has since resolved
itself into a certainty, and into the pivot on which all my action turns. I must
bore you with old memories once more, I'm afraid. You recollect that, while you
were at Combcardingham with our old friends Piggott and Wells, you formed an
acquaintance with a very pretty girl--a 'hand' in one of the factories? You
shake your head, eh? it <i>is</i> a long time since, and these sort of things
get pushed from one's mind by other affairs, and--however, I think you'll
recollect her when I mention her name. Does the name Ann Moore convey to
you--Ah! I thought so! I'll wait a minute, if you please; there's no hurry.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Go on, sir; go on!&quot; said Mr. Townshend, whose face was hidden in, and
supported by, his hands.</p>
<p>&quot;An attachment sprung up between you and Ann Moore, I think, which was the
cause of great distress to her only relation, a brother, with whom she lived.
This brother and you exchanged words--if not blows--on this subject, and the
result was that the girl left her brother and went to live with you. Did you
speak?&quot;</p>
<p>If he had spoken, he did not repeat what he had said, but sat there still and
silent.</p>
<p>&quot;She had been living with you for about a year when that unfortunate affair
of the acceptance happened. You were obliged to leave Combcardingham; but you
were not obliged, so far as I can make out, to leave it as you did--without
giving her the least notion of your intention; without leaving her one shilling
to support herself or your little child! She could not go back to the factory;
she had not been there since the child's birth; and she was weak and ill, and
unable to do the work. So she and the child starved.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Great God!&quot; cried the old man, looking up in horror--&quot;starved?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well--for all you had to do with it! You're just as much a murderer as if
they actually had perished of want, leaving them as you did But they didn't.
Neighbours found them out only just in time; found out her brother; and he, when
he found you'd gone off, came round and took his sister to his heart again. He
was a printer just starting for himself, and he took his sister--she'd always
been his favourite--to his new home; and there she died three weeks after her
arrival.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Died? Ann died? not of--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, not of starvation, if you mean that; they said she died of a broken
heart at having been deserted by the man she worshipped; but we know by medical
science that that's an impossibility--don't we? At all events, she died; and
then the printer, who was a rising man, looked after the little girl. He looked
after her in an odd way. He had a foster-brother, who was a rider in a circus;
and when the little girl was six years old he placed her with the circus-people,
where she remained until he started her in life on her own account.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She lived, then?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh dear, yes; lived considerably; lives now and flourishes, and does
extremely well. You have heard of a riding-mistress and horsebreaker, Miss Kate
Mellon?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have heard of such a person; and I have not heard--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Steady, please! Kate Mellon is Ann Moore's daughter. I need not point out
her relationship to you. You shake your head. Proofs of course you want? I've
taken the liberty of ringing the bell. Be good enough,&quot; added Mr. Simnel, to the
clerk who appeared, &quot;to tell that person who is waiting outside to step in. Do
you recognise him?&quot; he asked of Mr. Townshend, as Scadgers entered the room.</p>
<p>Mr. Townshend, shading his eyes with his hand, looked long at the new-comer,
and then said, &quot;It is George Moore!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right enough, sir,&quot; said Mr. Scadgers; &quot;though it's many a long day since we
met; and we're neither of us so young as then. Lord bless me! when I look at the
Runner--we used to call him the 'Runner' because of Townshend of Bow Street,
which was a nickname for him,&quot; added he, turning to Mr. Simnel,--&quot;when I look at
the Runner, and think how long it is since I left my mark on him about--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We won't trouble you for details,&quot; interrupted Mr. Simnel; &quot;this gentleman
acknowledges you as George Moore. Will you state whether you are the brother of
Ann Moore; and if so, what became of her and her child?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ann Moore was my sister,&quot; said Scadgers in a low voice, &quot;as this man knows
well enough. After he left the town suddenly and without giving her any notice,
without leaving her any money, without--there, though it's so long ago, it makes
me mad now when I think of it. When he left her starving and penniless, I took
such care of her and the little one as best I could. Then--poor Ann died, and
the child came to me. Young Phil Fox was my foster-brother; and he saw the
little girl, and his wife took a sort of fancy to her, having none of their own.
So I apprenticed her to old Fox, and she was with him for years, until I had got
on in life and made some money; and then I thought I'd do what was right by the
child, not letting myself be known in the matter, for I couldn't get over poor
Ann's disgrace; and I fetched her away and had her put to business for herself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You didn't have her called by her mother's or her father's name, I believe?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No; her mother's name was shame to me; her father's would have been worse;
so I called her Kate Mellon, after my mother's people; and by that name she's
gone ever since.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you. You hear this testimony, Mr. Townshend; you--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I hear! I hear!&quot; said the old man testily. &quot;I hear what may possibly be a
clever story arranged between two men for the purposes of extortion--&quot;</p>
<p>The black cloud settled on Mr. Simnel's face; but before he could speak,
Scadgers burst in: &quot;Extortion: if I'd wanted any thing of you, Mr. George
Townshend, shouldn't I have had it years ago? I've known where you've been and
what money you've been making for the last eighteen years; and if I'd wanted any
thing of you, I could have come down on you at any time. But I scorned it for me
or for my sister's flesh and blood, just as I scorn it now! Extortion! why--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There! you're very naturally annoyed and excited, my good sir; but I think
we shall bring Mr. Townshend to reason,&quot; said Mr. Simnel. &quot;I don't think I need
detain you any longer. I shall see you in a very short time, and, I hope, have
some satisfactory news to communicate. Good-day!&quot; and Mr. Simnel shook hands
with Mr. Scadgers, who made a very curt bow to Mr. Townshend, and departed. Then
Simnel turned to the old man, and said, &quot;I make every allowance for your
annoyance in this matter, Mr. Townshend; but you can no longer really doubt the
truth of this statement.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And suppose I admit it, sir; what then? To what end have you hunted up this
story and--and the other, which you hold <i>in terrorem</i> over me? What views
of yours am I to meet: What price am I to pay for past follies?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Follies is an easy word,&quot; said Simnel, with a grim smile; &quot;but I don't think
my proposition is a hard one. I am attached to Miss Moore--Kate Mellon--call her
what you like--your daughter, I mean--honourably attached to her; but you, as a
man of the world, will see that it would be impossible for me to marry a girl
who is simply known for her eccentricity and her daring; who has no position in
society--no relations--no any thing which the world demands, save money, and
even of that she has not sufficient. You follow me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, sir, yes,&quot; said Mr. Townshend, who had again buried his face in his
hands.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, then, what I propose,&quot; said Simnel, who was getting annoyed at the old
man's manner, &quot;and what, moreover, I intend, by means of the hold which I have
over you, to carry out, is this: you must acknowledge this young lady as your
daughter; take her to your house, and let her live there for a month or two; let
our wedding--a formal wedding, with all friends invited--take place from there;
and you must give her ten thousand pounds.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I refuse!&quot; said Mr. Townshend; &quot;I entirely refuse; I--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, no, you don't,&quot; interrupted Mr. Simnel; &quot;you'll think better of it. Why
shouldn't you? You gave Mrs. Schröder, who didn't want it at all, twenty
thousand; but you're not so well off just now, I know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How do you know that, you who are so well-informed on all my affairs?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I think I know pretty nearly every shilling you have out,&quot; said
Simnel, rubbing his knee; &quot;and Cotopaxis and Tierra del Fuegos have gone down
like water lately. No; as matters stand, I'll be content with ten thousand.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I did not so much mean about the money. I do not say that I would not pay
the sum you name to be rid of the annoyance; but I will never undergo the
humiliation of acknowledging that connexion.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Better that than the humiliation of standing in the Old-Bailey dock! Better
that than stone-quarrying at Portland at your time of life, sir, I can tell you,
besides humiliation. Nonsense! It is not as if the acknowledging this daughter
would hurt the prospects of the other. She has done with you now. If she marries
again, it will be as Mr. Schröder's widow, without reference to you. Don't you
understand?&quot; (&quot;He didn't like that allusion to Portland,&quot; said Simnel to
himself. &quot;I distinctly heard his teeth chatter as I said the word.&quot;)</p>
<p>&quot;I did not so much mean about the money. I do not say that I would not pay

himself. &quot;I distinctly heard his teeth chatter as I said the word.&quot;) &quot;And
suppose I were to consent to this proposition, sir,&quot; said the old man in a
tremulous voice, &quot;what guarantee have I that you might not come upon me at some
future time for more money, or the gratification of some other wish; and that,
on my refusal, you might not betray that horrible secret which you hold?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now, my dear sir, there your usual sound common-sense has for once deserted
you. Is it likely that, when once you are my father-in-law, I should proclaim a
gentleman whose connexion with me I had taken so much pains to make public,
as--pardon me--as a felon?&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Townshend cowered back in his chair, as Simnel, leaning forward to impart
additional earnestness to his manner, uttered these last words. For a minute or
two there was a dead silence; then the old-man, with a terrible effort at
collecting himself, asked, &quot;When do you require an answer to this demand?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An answer? Immediately! I cannot conceive that there can be any question as
to the answer to be returned. I am sure that you, my good sir, could not be mad
enough to object to what is, under all the circumstances, really a very
reasonable proposition. I merely want you to pass your word to agree to what I
have placed before you, and we will then settle the time for carrying the
arrangement into effect.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What delay will you grant me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now, upon my word, Mr. Townshend,&quot; said Simnel, in a semi-offended tone,
&quot;this is scarcely polite. You ask for delay, as though you were ordered for
execution, instead of having what might have been a very unpleasant affair
settled in a thoroughly satisfactory manner.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You must pardon me, sir,&quot; said Mr. Townshend; &quot;I am an old man now. I am
broken with illness; and this interview has been too much for me. Pray end it as
speedily as possible.&quot; Indeed he looked as wan and haggard as a corpse.</p>
<p>&quot;Poor devil!&quot; thought Simnel, &quot;I pity him thoroughly. But there must be no
shrinking now, and no delay, or that Schröder-Beresford business may fall
through; and then--&quot; &quot;I must get you to act at once, then, Mr. Townshend, if you
please,&quot; he said aloud. &quot;Your daughter had better come to you at once, and we
can then be married in a month or six weeks' time.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Townshend bowed his head. &quot;As you please, sir; perhaps you will see me
again to-morrow, or the day after. Just now I can settle nothing; my head is
gone.&quot; And so the interview ended.</p>
<p>&quot;I must keep him to it, by Jove!&quot; soliloquised Mr. Simnel; &quot;and pretty tight
too, or it will fall through yet. He looked horribly ill, and he'll be going off
the hooks without any recognition or any settlement, and then we should be
neatly in the hole; for, of course, not one single soul would believe the story
of Kitty's birth, though told by me and sworn to by Scadgers. And now I must let
her know the whole truth, and ask for the reward. It's been a hard fight, and it
isn't won yet.&quot;</p>

<h4><a name="div1_37" href="#div1Ref_37">CHAPTER XXXVII.</a></h4>
<h5>MINISTERING ANGELS.</h5>
<br>
<p>A crowd gathered round her in an instant. A nursery-maid, with her shrieking,
frightened, inquisitive charges; a man who had been reading a book, and who
still retained it open in his hand; a Life-guardsman who, jauntily striding
along with a cane under his arm, had seen the horse jump and fall, and had him
by the bridle so soon as he staggered to his feet, after rolling; a few vagrant
boys, who came whooping from under the trees where they had been at play; and
two old gentlemen, who had been silently pacing up and down together. Flecked
with foam, covered with gravel, and bleeding at the knees and mouth, Balthazar
stood trembling all over; and now and then looking down in wonder at his
mistress who lay there, her head supported on a man's knee, her face deadly
white, with one small thread of blood trickling down her forehead. The man on
whose knee she lay passed his hand rapidly down her side and in the region of
her heart. He was a park-keeper--a big brown-bearded man, whose decorated breast
showed what deadly service he had seen--a stalwart giant with the heart of a
child, for the tears were in his eyes, and his voice was any thing but steady as
he looked up and said, &quot;It beats yet!&quot; It was to the guardsman he said it--the
guardsman, who gave Balthazar's bit a wrench, and who muttered hearty curses on
the horse for spoiling the beauty of such a comely lass.</p>
<p>&quot;All your fault, you blunder-headed brute, it was! The lady sat him like a
bird, but he got the bit between his teeth and came bolting down the Row; and
when she tried to turn him over the rails, he jumped short, the beast, and went
slap on to his head. Yarr!&quot; and he gave the horse another chuck in the mouth,
and looked as if he would have liked nothing so well as to punish him on the
spot.</p>
<p>As he spoke, a carriage drawn by a pair of horses came whirling down the
Drive. It contained two ladies, one of whom, seeing the crowd, sat up, and
pointed it out to her companion. Then they both looked eagerly out, and checked
the coachman just as they reached the spot. By his mistress's orders the footman
descended, inquired what had happened, and returned to the carriage to report.
The next minute Alice Schröder, closely followed by Barbara Churchill, was
kneeling by Kate Mellon's side.</p>
<p>What was it?--how had it happened?--who was the lady?--did any one know
her?--had a doctor been sent for? These questions were asked in a breath, and
almost as speedily answered. The story of the accident, so much of it at least
as had been witnessed, was narrated. The park-keeper knew the lady by sight as a
constant rider in the Row, always splendidly mounted, generally with other
ladies, who, he thought, were pupils like; real ladies, the latter, and no doubt
about it; for he thought he saw a glimmer of distrust in Barbara's eye; and this
poor lady regularly like one of themselves. Poor lady! always so affable, giving
&quot;Good morning&quot; to him and the other park-keepers--never knew her name, no; but
no harm in her--one of the right sort, take his word for it. Had a doctor been
sent for? Yes; two of the vagrant boys had been started off by the man with the
book to fetch the nearest surgeon; but in the mean time several other persons
had come up; among them a tall thin gentleman on an old white horse. This
gentleman dismounted at once, quietly pushed his way through the crowd, knelt
down by poor Kate Mellon's senseless body, and placed his finger on her pulse;
then, looking up with a grave, thoughtful, professional smile into Mrs.
Schröder's face, said:</p>
<p>&quot;You are a friend of this lady's?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Only in my desire to serve her,&quot; said poor little Alice, who was the
best-hearted little creature in the world, and who was bursting with
philanthropy. &quot;Why do you ask?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Simply that she must be moved to the nearest house as quietly and as quickly
as possible. I am Dr. B.,&quot; continued the gentleman, naming a well-known
physician; &quot;but this is a surgeon's case, and should be seen by a surgeon at
once. I fear St. George's is almost too far off.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;St. George's!&quot; said Alice. &quot;Oh, she must not go to an hospital; she--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My dear lady,&quot; said the old physician, &quot;she could not go to any place so
good; but it is a little far off.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then let her go to my house,&quot; said Alice. &quot;I live close here--in Saxe-Coburg
Square--just through Queen's Gate. Let us take her there at once, and--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My dear young lady,&quot; said Dr. B., &quot;you scarcely know what trouble you are
entailing on yourself. This poor girl is in a very bad way, I am sure, from the
mere cursory examination I have been able to make. And--and, pardon me,&quot; he
added, glancing at Alice's widow's-cap, &quot;but you, surely, have seen enough
trouble already for one so young.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Will you be kind enough to superintend her being lifted into the carriage?&quot;
was all Alice said in reply. And the doctor bowed, and looked at her with a
wonderfully benevolent expression out of his keen gray eyes.</p>
<p>Where had Barbara been during this colloquy? Where, but at the side of the
prostrate figure, staunching the little stream of blood that welled slowly from
the wound in the forehead, and bathing the deadly-cold brow and the limp hands
with water that had been fetched from the neighbouring Serpentine. And then, at
the doctor's suggestion, the park-keeper fetched a hurdle from the enclosure,
and this they stretched across the seats of the carriage, and, covering it with
Shawls and cloaks and wraps, lifted on to it the prostrate form of Kate Mellon,
and with Alice and Barbara attendant on her, and the doctor riding close by,
they drove slowly away.</p>
<p>Informed by the doctor that it would be dangerous to attempt to carry the
patient upstairs, Mrs. Schröder had sent the footman on with instructions; and
by the time they arrived at the house they found that a bed had been prepared in
the library, a room on the ground floor, unused since Mr. Schröder's death. As
they passed through Queen's Gate Dr. B. had cantered off, promising to return in
a minute, and they had scarcely laid poor Kitty on the bed before he appeared,
followed by a handsome bald-headed man, with a keen eye and a smile of singular
sweetness, wham he introduced as Mr. Slade, the celebrated surgeon of St.
Vitus's.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought I recognised Slade's cab standing at a door in Prince's Terrace.
He drives the most runaway horse in the most easily over-turned vehicle in
London; but I suppose he thinks he can set his own neck when he breaks it, which
he is safe to do sooner or later; so I rode round, and fortunately caught him
just as he was coming out. And now I'll leave the case in his hands; it would be
impossible to leave it in better.&quot; And so saying, Dr. B. bowed to the ladies,
exchanged a laugh and a pinch of snuff with his brother-professional, and took
his leave.</p>
<p>Mr. Slade then approached the bed, and made a rapid examination of the
patient, the others watching him anxiously. His face revealed nothing, nor did
he speak until he sent one of the servants for a small square box, which was, he
said, in his carriage. While waiting for this, Alice took heart to speak to him,
and ask him if the case was very serious.</p>
<p>&quot;Very,&quot; was his quiet reply. &quot;Could scarcely be worse.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But there <i>is</i> hope?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There is always hope,&quot; said the old man, his lace lighting up with his sweet
grave smile; &quot;but this is a very bad case. The poor girl's ribs are severely
fractured, and there is concussion here,&quot; pointing to the head, &quot;which causes
her insensibility. The box--thank you. Now, ladies, will you kindly leave the
room, and I will join you presently.&quot;</p>
<p>When he came into the drawing-room, he said, &quot;It is a compound fracture, and
of a very bad kind. I fear she will never pull through; if she does, she must
never dream of work again. I presume you ladies have been pupils of hers?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pupils!&quot; said Alice; &quot;no, indeed; was she a governess?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We do not even know this poor lady's name,&quot; said Barbara; &quot;we saw the
accident, and Mrs. Schröder had her brought here at once.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mrs. Schröder is an angel of mercy,&quot; said Mr. Slade, with an old-fashioned
bow. &quot;This poor girl lying downstairs is Miss Mellon, a riding-mistress; a most
correct and proper person, I've always heard, and one who had a great deal to do
in breaking and training horses. I've often seen her in the Park; she rode
splendidly; and I cannot conceive how this accident occurred.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you think her senses will return--that she will be able to express any
wishes--before--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I should think so,&quot; said Mr. Slade, not permitting Barbara to finish the
sentence; &quot;I think she will probably recover from the concussion, and then she
will be sensible. It is the fracture I fear. I'll send a man to her place in
Down Street, to let them know where she is, and I'll look round again this
evening.&quot;</p>
<p>SO there Kate Mellon lay helpless, senseless, motionless, watched over
unconsciously by two women, one of whom she hated deeply, and by the other of
whom she was held in the greatest detestation. There she lay through the dreary
afternoon, through the long evening,--when Mr. Slade came again bringing with
him one of the hospital-nurses,--and through the dead solemn night. Very early
the next morning, between seven and eight, Barbara, on her way from her bedroom
to the library, was surprised to see Mr. Slade enter the hall, and expressed her
surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, it <i>is</i> early,&quot; said the kind-hearted surgeon; &quot;but, my dear Mrs.
Churchill, I've taken a great interest in this poor girl; and as I always take a
constitutional round the Park before breakfast, I thought I'd just run across
and see her.--Well, nurse, what news? None, eh? Just raise that curtain the
least bit--that'll do. Hm! she'll get rid of the concussion; but--hm! well,
well, not our will, but Thine; hm, hm! Any body come after her yesterday?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An old bailiff or stud-groom,&quot; said Barbara, &quot;came down in the evening, and
entreated to be allowed to see his Mistress. I told him that was impossible, and
explained the state of things to him myself. Poor fellow, he was dreadfully
overcome, the tears rolled down his cheeks, and he bemoaned his mistress's fate
most bitterly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hm! right not to let him see her then; could have done no good. But she'll
probably come to her senses during the day, and then, if she asks to see any
body--well, send for them. The refusal might irritate her, and--and it can make
very little difference.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You think then she is--in danger?&quot; asked Barbara.</p>
<p>&quot;My dear young lady,&quot; said he, taking her hand, &quot;in the greatest danger. If
inflammation of the lungs sets in, as I much fear it will, nothing can save
her.--Nurse, I'll write a prescription for a cordial. If she speaks, and sends
for any one, give it to her just before they come. It will revive her for a
time.&quot;</p>
<p>About midday, when Alice had gone out for a little air, and Barbara was left
alone with the nurse and the patient, there came a groan from the bed, and
running up together, they found Kate with her eyes open, staring vaguely before
her. After a few minutes she spoke, in a hoarse strange voice.</p>
<p>&quot;What's this?&quot; she said. &quot;Have I missed my tip at the ribbons and had a
spill? Lord, how old Fox will give it me! A-h, my side! This must have been a
bad cropper, eh? Hollo! I was fancying I was at the old circus, again. Where am
I? who are you? what has happened?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are, with friends,&quot; said Barbara, kneeling by the bed; &quot;you have had an
accident, and--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, now I recollect! the Irish horse bolted and blundered at the rails! How
long ago was it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday, about this time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And I was brought here--to your house! What a kind voice you've got! and I'm
bad, eh? I know I must be from the pain I'm in; my side hurts me most awful. Has
the doctor seen me? what doctor?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Slade: you've heard of him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, yes, seen him often; drives a rat-tailed bay in a D'Orsay cab; goes the
pace; often wondered he didn't break his neck. What does he--oh! my side!&quot; She
groaned deeply, and while groaning seemed to drop off into a heavy stertorous
slumber.</p>
<p>When she roused again Mr. Slade was standing over her holding her pulse.
&quot;Well,&quot; he asked in a gentle voice, &quot;you know me? Ah, of course you do! I've
seen you taking stock of my old rattletrap, as you've spun by me, and laughing
at my nag. Pain still? kind of pressure, eh? Yes, yes, my poor lass, I know what
you mean; so dreadfully weak too; yes, yes. What, danger? Wen, my dear, there's
always danger in these cases; and one never knows. Not afraid? no, my brave
girl, I know your courage; but--well, there's no harm in settling any little
matters which--eh? if in God's will we come all right, there's no harm done,
and,---yes, yes; rest now a bit; I'll see you again to-night.&quot; And Mr. Slade
hurried into his carriage, blowing his Rose very loudly indeed with his red-silk
pocket-handkerchief, and with two large tears on his spectacle-glasses..</p>
<p>When the door had shut behind him, Kate called the nurse in a feeble voice,
and bade her send for the lady to whom she had previously spoken. In answer to
this call, Barbara was speedily by the bedside.</p>
<p>&quot;You--you don't mind my sending for you! do you, dear?&quot; asked Kate, in a low
tremulous voice.</p>
<p>&quot;Mind, my poor child,--mind! of course not. What is it, dear?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I want you to--do you mind, giving me your hand? I can't reach it
myself--so, dear; thank you. I want you to do something for me. I--I'm dying,
dear--oh, don't shrink from me--I know it; he tried to hide it from me, that
kind old man, and bless him for it! but I saw how he looked at the nurse, and I
heard her whispering to him behind the screen. I don't fear it, dear. I
know--well, never mind! I want to see two people before I go; and I want you to
send for them and let them come here, and let me talk to them--will you, dear?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, of course, of course,&quot; said Barbara, the tears streaming down her
cheeks; &quot;but you mustn't talk in this way,--you mustn't give way so--no one can
tell how this will turn out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<i>I</i> can,&quot; said Kate quietly. &quot;I seemed to know it when I heard the
click of that horse's shoes against the iron railing. It all rose before me in
an instant, and I knew I was a dead woman. You can't conceive--I haven't said
much--but you can't conceive what torture I'm going through with my side. It
burns and burns, and presses--there! I won't say any more about it. Now, dear,
will you put down the names of the people who are to be sent to?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I shall recollect them; tell me now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, Mr. Simnel, Tin-Tax Office, Rutland House--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes; and--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And Frank Churchill, Esq.--oh, how your grasp tightens on my hand! Frank
Churchill, Esq., <i>Statesman</i> newspaper-office--in the City
somewhere--they'll find it. What is the matter, dear? You heard me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Barbara faintly; &quot;they shall be sent for at once.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;At last,&quot; said she to herself when she had regained her own room, after
despatching the messenger--&quot;at last I shall be enabled to fathom this horrible
mystery, and to show those who have doubted, that I was not wrong, after all, in
taking the decisive step which I did. If this wretched creature prove to be--as
I suppose she will--Frank's correspondent both at Bissett and at home; if--and
yet Mr. Slade said he believed her to be a perfectly correct and proper person,
else he would not have permitted her to be received here. Mr. Slade's
belief--what is that worth? Is it possible that--no! Here is a woman, poor
creature, believing herself to be on her deathbed, and sending for my
husband,--a woman of whose existence I have never heard, who is obviously not a
person of society, and yet who--great Heavens, if it be proved!--if the worst
that I have dared to imagine be proved! And yet lately I have felt that that is
impossible, in thinking over Frank's character and ways of life, in thinking
over all he has said of dishonour and deception, I have felt certain that--and
yet here is this woman sending for him not to his private house,--'<i>Statesman</i>
office, somewhere in the City--they'll find it.' <i>Statesman</i> Office! That's
where the first letter was addressed, and redirected to Bissett; and the second
letter,--the envelope, I mean,--now I think of it, was sent to the same place.
It <i>must</i> be the same. And yet how sweet, and patient, and resigned she is!
how quiet and calm, and--Frank Churchill, Esq.--no mistake in both the names!
Who is the other man, I wonder? Frank Churchill! what an extraordinary fate has
planned this for us! I'll see their interview, and hear all that she has to say;
and then if--of course it can't be otherwise--what other solution can there be?
If Frank has intrigued with this--and she going to die too; lying there at the
point of death, and looking up into my face with so much gratitude and
affection--oh, Heaven direct me! I'm at my wits'-end!&quot; and Barbara threw herself
on her bed and wept bitterly.</p>
<p>The short dim twilight had faded into dusk before the cab containing the
messenger and the two gentlemen whom he had been sent to fetch arrived at the
house. They were ushered at once into the dining-room, where they were received
by Pilkington the butler, who produced refreshment. That being declined, they
were shown into the library. In the middle of the room stood the bed in deep
shadow; across the far end of the room stood a large folding screen, almost
hidden by which was a woman with her back to them, bending over a table and
apparently engaged in compounding some medicine or drink. A shaded lamp placed
on a table between the bed and the screen shed a dim light throughout the room.
As the door opened, Mr. Simnel entered first, with a faltering step, strode
swiftly to the bedside, and then dropped on to his knees, burying his face in
his hands. Kate moved her arm with great difficulty until her hand rested on his
head, and then she said, half trustingly, half reproachfully, &quot;Robert!&quot; There
was no spoken reply, but the man's big strong frame heaved up and down
convulsively, and the tears came rushing thick as rain through his closed
fingers.</p>
<p>&quot;Robert, my poor fellow! you must not give way so; you'll break me down. I
hadn't a notion you--and yet how faithfully you've served! I saw it, Robert; I
knew it long ago, when--ah, well, all over now; all over now, Robert, eh?--What,
Guardy, you here too! That's well. Ah, I feel so much more composed now I see
your dear solemn old face. You came at once.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Came at once, my poor child--my poor dear child--&quot; and Churchill's voice
failed him and he stopped.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, Guardy, come! You won't have much more trouble with your bothering
charge, and you must be steady now. It gives me fresh courage, I declare, to
hear your solemn voice and to know that you're at my very side for all sorts of
serious advice.--Now, Robert, you know that I'm in a bad way; that I'm going
to--no, no, be a man, Robert; you'll upset me, if you give way so,--Guardy, this
gentleman, Mr. Simnel, has been very, very kind to me for a long, long time. He
wanted to marry me, Guardy; and wanted me to have a proper place as his wife,
and so he's been hunting up all about my friends and my birth and that, and he's
found out a lot. But he doesn't know about you, Guardy; and as I wanted to tell
him about that, and to settle one other thing, I sent for you both to-night.
The--the medicine!--ask nurse--I'm a little faint!&quot;</p>
<p>Both men rose; but Simnel was nearest, and it was into his hand that the
woman behind the screen placed the glass. When Kate had swallowed the cordial,
she said, in firmer tones:</p>
<p>&quot;I told you, Robert, that when I left old Fox's circus I was fetched away by
two gentlemen, an old fellow and another. This is the other. When we got to the
hotel that night, the old man said to me, 'Never you mind who I am, my lass; you
won't see me any more after I've once started you in town; but you will see this
gentleman, and you'll have to send to him whenever you want advice or any thing
else. He's your guardian,' he said, 'and he'll look after you.' I recollect I
laughed, and said he looked very young, and giggled out some girl's nonsense;
but he--I can see you now, Guardy!--put his hand on my head and told me he was
much older than I, and that he'd had plenty of experience to teach him the ways
of the world. I've never seen the old man since; but, oh, how often I've sent
for Guardy! I've worried him day and night, written to him whenever I wanted to
know any thing: how to treat swells who wouldn't pay, or who were getting
troublesome in other ways; when I wanted the landlord seen, or fresh land
bought; when--good Lord! when I lost heart over--something--and thought of
giving the place up, and selling off and going away, he's kept me as straight as
a die; he's never shown the least ill-temper with all my worryings and
fidgettings; he's always shown me what to do for the best--and has been my
kindest and least selfish and best friend.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You say too much, Kate,&quot; said Churchill; &quot;any thing I have done you have
repaid long since by your good sense and docility.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You could never be repaid, sir, I see plainly enough,&quot; said Simnel; &quot;there
are few men who would have so acquitted themselves of each a charge, and I shall
ever honour and esteem you for it. But may I ask how you came to be known to the
other person of this story, who from some knowledge I guess to be Scadgers the
bill-discounter?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is easily explained. When I arrived in London from Germany, and
determined to make my bread by literature, I wrote where I could, and for what I
could get. Some article of mine was seen by Mr. Scadgers. who then owned,
amongst other lucrative speculations, a weekly newspaper and a cheap periodical.
Pleased with what he had read--or had recommended to him more likely--he sent
for me, and after a little discussion, made me editor and manager of both his
literary speculations. He paid liberally, and seemed pleased with all I did;
then wanted me to undertake the management of others of his affairs, which I
declined. But one night in his office he told me the story of this
girl--incidentally, as a suggestion for a tale for the paper, I believe; and so
interested me that I suggested his removing her from the life she was then
leading, and giving her a chance of doing something for herself. After some
discussion he agreed, on the understanding that he should never appear in the
matter; but that if he provided the necessary funds, I would manage the whole
business and undertake a kind of guardianship of the girl. I hesitated, until I
saw her at the circus; then, being somewhat of a physiognomist, and thinking I
saw in her face promise of what was wanted--honesty, endurance, and a power of
keeping straight in front of adverse circumstances--I consented. The rest you
know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Will you take my hand, Mr. Churchill?&quot; said Simnel in a low voice; &quot;God
Almighty bless you for--for your kindness and your trust!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's right!&quot; said Kate on whom the action had not passed
unobserved--&quot;shake hands, you two, good fellows both of you! And now look
here--but one word! I didn't catch all you said, Guardy, but you and Robert seem
to have made it all right. And now I want to tell you about
something--about--when I'm gone, you know--oh, you silly fellow, Robert, how can
I speak if you go on so!--I've put away some money, you know; and I want you to
have it, Guardy. You're married, some one told me; and you'll want all that; and
you won't despise it, eh? You know it's all honestly come by, and you've seen
how it's been made--my accounts, you know, you used to say they were very
decently kept; and there'll be no shame in taking it--your wife, I mean, and
that sort of thing; you can tell her about it. I wonder what she's like. I
should have liked to have seen her, Guardy, though perhaps she wouldn't have
cared for such as I. Oh, poor old Freeman and the men at The Den--let them have
a year's wages; I've put it all regular in a will which I made last year; you'll
find it in the desk; and sell the stud--high prices, most of them. I--my side's
awful now; don't go yet; let me have a little--just a little rest. I'm faint,
and in such--such dreadful pain!&quot;</p>
<p>She fell back exhausted. Simnel still knelt by the bedside convulsed with
grief; but Frank Churchill looked round the screen to summon the nurse. No one
was there, so he went to the door and called softly. The nurse responded at once
and passed by him; but as he turned back he saw the butler, who beckoned to him.</p>
<p>&quot;Will you please to step this way, sir?&quot; said the man; &quot;you're wanted in the
dining-room.&quot;</p>
<p>Churchill followed him; and as the dining-room door shut behind him, found
himself face to face with his wife.</p>

<h5>UNDER PRESSURE.</h5>
<br>
<p>The dulness of the autumnal season causing a heavy depression every where, by
no means relaxed its maleficent influence in room No. 120 of the Tin-Tax Office.
The gentlemen therein located had each, as has every man in the world, his own
private griefs, anxieties, and worries; and these never blossomed into such full
vigour as in the autumn. In the first place, there was no more leave of absence
to look forward to, which was, in itself, a dreadful thing; and then there was
looming in the future the approach of Christmas, a dread season which each of
the different denizens of No. 120, for different reasons, regarded with dismay.
To kind genial Mr. Kinchenton the coming Christmas was specially fearful; for
after a long struggle between inclination and duty, a struggle resulting in the
victory of the latter, he had decided upon sending his boy Percy, the apple of
his eye, to school after the Christmas holidays; and in the shadow of that
coming event he was sitting moping and melancholy. Mr. Dibb was always bad in
the autumn; his liver, always rebellious, was thoroughly intractable at that
season known as the &quot;fall of the leaf,&quot; and remained perfectly quiet, declining
to perform any one of the functions intrusted to it, and calmly spurning any
attempt to call it into action. So Mr. Dibb's complexion grew more and more like
that of the cover of a well-worn school-copy of Ainsworth's Dictionary; and Mr.
Dibb's temper became so cranky, that Mr. Crump, the extra-clerk, lived in a
perfect cyclone of torn-up letters and accounts to &quot;do over again;&quot; so that said
Crump bemoaned his hard fate, and expressed himself as perfectly certain that he
should have an earlier attack of chilblains than usual that year. Mr. Boppy too
had his private grief, in the shape of a visitor at his establishment, Mrs.
Boppy's mamma, a lady of vast size from the manufacturing districts, who had
arrived on a month's visit, had monopolised the best portion of Mr. Boppy's
house, and who demanded to have life shown to her. So Mrs. Boppy had instructed
Mr. Boppy to convey her and her mamma to the Thames Tunnel, the top of the
Monument, the Crypt of St. Paul's, to the Tower, to Madame Tussaud's wax-work,
and other exhibitions much sought after by country people, but seldom visited by
Londoners; and had moreover stimulated her husband to ask for various
half-holidays, which Mr. Kinchenton would readily have granted, but which were
never obtained without a hand-to-hand combat with Mr. Dibb. &quot;Very well, Mr.
Kinchenton,&quot; he would say, &quot;Mr. Boppy must go, sir, if you say so, of course.
You're the head of this room, I believe; though how the work's to be got through
with Mr. Prescott absent on leave, Mr. Crump next to useless, and Mr. Pringle,
who always takes three-quarters of an hour to his lunch--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What's that you're saying about me, Mr. Dibb?&quot; Mr. Pringle would ask from
over the top of his desk.</p>
<p>&quot;Says you take three-quarters of an hour for your lunch,&quot; would repeat the
revengeful Boppy.</p>
<p>&quot;All right! better do that than make yourself a wretched hypochondriac, like
some people. Let digestion wait on appetite, and health on both, Boppy! Mr.
Dibb's got none of the three; doesn't know what any of them mean; so we must
excuse him.&quot; And then Mr. Boppy would get his leave, and go away and do dismal
duty with his relatives.</p>
<p>Nor was Mr. Pringle in any thing like his usual flow of spirits. He was very
mercurial, tremendously affected by the weather; and black skies, cold winds,
and empty streets sent him down to zero. Moreover his other-half, his chum, his
bosom-friend, Mr. Prescott, was away on leave, paying his long-promised visit to
old Mr. Murray of Brooklands; and so Mr. Pringle was left to himself, and sat in
his chambers smoking solitary pipes, and learning whole pages of the Comic
Song-Book, and perpetually falling asleep over the first page of the volume of
Boswell's <i>Life of Johnson</i>. For Mr. Kinchenton, who took great interest in
honest George, had told him that no man was worth any thing unless he read
something besides trashy novels and Little Warblers; and Mr. Pringle,
determining to &quot;go-in for something heavy,&quot; had selected the life of Dr.
Johnson, whose <i>Rasselas</i> he had read as a child, remembering it as &quot;the
adventures of a young cove and an old cove, with a doosid good bit about a
bridge, or something, in it.&quot; Moreover George Pringle was by no means
comfortable as to the state of his friend's money-matters. He had himself
&quot;ignored,&quot; as he phrased it, all his own transactions with Scadgers; but he was
in with Prescott on one bill, and he knew that his friend had involved himself
with several other pieces of stamped paper in the hands of the same worthy. And
George had a strange notion that some of these were overdue; and knowing that
the Long Vacation was rapidly drawing to a close, and that Term-time was coming
on, he feared that the mighty engines of the law might be set to work, and come
a general smash. He had written to Prescott about it; but had only received a
couple of lines in reply, to say that he was very jolly, and that the things
would be all right; so that all he could do was patiently to await his friend's
return to town.</p>
<p>That happened one night, when Pringle and Boswell had had a severe
disagreement, and Pringle had let Boswell drop into the fender, and had gone to
sleep with his pipe in the corner of his mouth. There came a heavy bang at the
oak, and Pringle, starting up and opening it, found himself face to face with
James Prescott,--rosy, stout, jolly, and beaming, with a big portmanteau in his
hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Hallo! old man!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hallo! old man! been asleep, eh? lazy old beggar! wanted me to rouse you up!
give us a hand to the portmanteau, George, and help him in! that's it! Well,&quot;
taking off his coat and making a dive at his friend, and catching him by the
shoulders, and peering inquiringly into his face, &quot;and how goes it? what's the
news? how are all the buffers at the shop? any body dead? any body got the sack?
no promotion? always our luck!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Things are much the same, I think; no news any where; they'll be glad to see
you back, for they've been grumbling about the work--not that you'll be much
help at that, though. And what have you been doing? had a good time?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good time? stunning!&quot; and Mr. Prescott kissed his fingers and waved them in
the air. &quot;Never put in such a time in my life. Old boy was splendaceous, did
every mortal thing one wanted,--good nag to ride, good shooting, capital cellar,
let you smoke where you like--no end! My old governor was there too, as happy as
a bird!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And the young lady--Miss Murray?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Emily! oh, I can't tell you how good that has turned out! She's out and
away nicer than any thing that ever was; no nonsense about her; quiet, ladylike,
sweet, affectionate little thing! You know, George, there are some women--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; interrupted Mr. Pringle--&quot;I know there are! and there are some men who
want a glass of grog--and I'm one; and there are others who are mad spoony--and
you're another! I'll mix for you, and we'll light our pipes, and then I shall be
in a better frame of mind to listen to jour dilation on Miss Murray's
excellences.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Prescott, so soon as their glasses were before them, their pipes in their
mouths, and they were established one on either side of the fireplace, lost no
time in availing himself of his friend's permission, and plunged into those
amatory raptures which we have all of us suffered under at our friends' hands.
The singular difference of the young lady to, and her superiority over, every
one else, the mixture of sense and sensibility which she displayed, the clever
things she said and did, her delicacy, firmness, bashfulness, presence of
mind,--all these were dilated on at full length by one gentleman, and listened
to with becoming patience by the other. At last, when his friend fairly stopped
for want of breath, Mr. Pringle asked,</p>
<p>&quot;And have you put it all right, Jim? of course you're not carrying on this
kind of thing without meaning it; have you squared it with them all?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, Emily and I understand each other thoroughly; and it's all arranged
between us, I think. I mean that I haven't said anything, you know; but people
don't say any thing now in such cases. There's a kind of a--a--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; interrupted Pringle--&quot;yes; I suppose there is. But what about her
father?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I haven't spoken to the old boy yet. Not that I think he'd make much
objection, turn rusty, or any thing of that sort, for he's tremendously kind and
jolly; but I don't like to talk to him while I've got these infernal debts
hanging over me. I don't think it's fair; and yet--Have you heard any thing from
old Scadgers, George?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, I haven't heard any thing; but--Never mind, we'll talk about him
to-morrow, when you've had a rest, and we're both clearer and cooler than we are
now. Now turn in and get a sleep, old man; good-night!&quot;</p>
<p>The next morning, however, when Mr. Pringle introduced the subject of Mr.
Scadgers and the acceptances which he held, Mr. Prescott showed a remarkable
alacrity in changing the conversation, an alacrity which he exhibited on two or
three subsequent occasions. He was in the habit, Pringle observed, of receiving
every morning with the greatest regularity a pink-coloured note with a country
postmark, and after reading its contents he became very much absorbed, slightly
ethereal, and generally indisposed to converse on mundane matters. But honest
George Pringle, who had no such pleasant distractions, knew perfectly well that
time was running on, and that some positive step must be taken; so on the fourth
morning after his friend's return he tackled him resolutely.</p>
<p>&quot;I say, Jim, about those bills? No good fencing about the business any
longer; we <i>must</i> go into it, or we shall come to grief. I've a notion that
some of them are overdue already, and I wonder Scadgers hasn't been here
pressing for either a settlement or a renewal.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To tell you the truth, George, I'm in a funk about them myself. I saw a very
suspicious-looking Jew outside the office as I came in this morning,--a fellow
in rusty black, with a blazing nose; and when he came towards me my heart jumped
into my mouth. However, he only asked me which was Mr. Beresford's office--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Beresford's?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, our swell Commissioner, you know; so I got off easy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What's the entire figure that you're liable for--including mine, and all the
rest of them, I mean?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The entire figure? well, it can't be far off a couple of hundred. I had to
spend such a lot when Emily was in town; pit-stalls whenever she went to the
Opera, to be near her, and hire of horses, and my share of two or three
Greenwich dinners, and all that, walked into no end of tin. I don't know where
the deuce I'm to get it, and that's the fact.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you owe any thing else? tailors or boot-makers, or any fellows of that
sort?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not a sixpence! I cleared what little bills I had of that kind with part of
old Scadgers' money. And since I got that rise here last month, I could go on as
straight as possible on what I get. But it's the infernal millstone of a back
debt round my neck. I don't know what to do! I can't go and ask the dear old
governor to advance; he's got quite enough to do with his income, and he'd be
awfully knocked over to hear I was in for such a lot.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course you can't. Now, look here; I'll tell you what you must do. You
must first pledge your word to me and to yourself--not that any thing can be
raised upon it, but it's the right thing to do--that you won't borrow another
sixpence. And then you must go to old Scadgers and tell him that you're in a
fix; that you can't pay him in a lump: but that you'll let him have so much
every quarter of the principal, and pay decent interest until it's cleared off.
You must draw-in your horns a little, and live quietly on the remainder. I'll go
security for you to old Scadgers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're a trump, George; but do you think he'll do it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do it? he must. He makes far too good an income out of the fellows in this
place and other government-offices to have any public row made about him and his
goings-on. If it got blown, they'd have a leader on him in the <i>Scourge</i>
that would take the skin off his old back, and, worse than that, stop his
business entirely. No, no; he'll do it fast enough. But we must go to him in a
regular business manner. Now what are the dates and amounts of these different
things?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I've got a memorandum of them in my desk, that I made at the time. I'll get
it out. Hallo!&quot; said Prescott, opening his desk, and taking therefrom a sealed
letter; &quot;what's this?&quot; holding it up.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, by Jove, I forgot to tell you! that came while you were away, and I put
it in your desk, thinking to name it to you directly you returned. Nothing
particular, I hope?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know; it's very thick, and I don't know the hand. It cannot be a
writ, eh?&quot; and Prescott turned very pale.</p>
<p>&quot;Writ, nonsense! they don't send writs by post. Don't you know the
handwriting? it's not round enough for a lawyer's. Open it, man; open it at
once!&quot;</p>
<p>And so, wanting to know the contents of the letter, they actually thought of
opening it.</p>
<p>As Prescott opened the envelope he drew from it a thick roll of papers, and
unfolding them, looked at them with wonder. Pringle, looking over his shoulder,
started; and, taking them from his friend's hand, exclaimed,</p>
<p>&quot;Bills, by Jove! cancelled bills look here, the signature torn off and
hanging. The very bills you gave to Scadgers; mine, Compter's, your IOU, and the
lot! You've been chaffing me, Jim--getting a rise out of me all this time, eh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean by getting a rise? I'm as innocent in this matter as
yourself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But do you mean to say that you didn't pay them?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I mean to say that I've never paid Scadgers one individual sixpence!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then I mean to say that you're a devilish lucky fellow; for somebody else
has.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are these bills paid, then?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, don't be so preposterously green, Jim. Are the bills paid? Of course
they are! paid and returned to you to put in the fire, or do what you like with;
you can never be called on for another penny. Well, you're a lucky fellow. No
one ever paid any thing for me. Who the deuce can have done this for you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I haven't the remotest idea. It couldn't be Scadgers himself?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;N--no!&quot; said Mr. Pringle, grinning from ear to ear. &quot;No, I don't think it
was Scadgers; he's not entirely in that line. Who is there that knew you were in
a fix?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No one, not a soul but yourself, and--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, old fellow; I've not paid them, I'll take my oath. Should have been
delighted to help you, but hadn't the wherewith.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then I'm done. I haven't a notion who can have helped me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, it doesn't matter, so long as it's done. You're in luck's way, my boy.
All this horrible excitement and doubt brought to an end, and you free as air. I
say, how about the keeping quiet and not launching into any extra expense, now?
Will you hold to it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll swear I will. And, what's more, now I am free, I'll strike while the
iron's hot. To-day's Friday; to-morrow a half-holiday. I'll go down to
Brooklands by the 2.40 train.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think you're right, Jim,&quot; said Pringle, quietly. &quot;You've had your fling,
and you seem to have a chance of settling well in life just now. Tell the old
father all about yourself--your income and your chances, I mean,--and don't give
him the opportunity of flinging any thing in your teeth hereafter. Well, whoever
paid that amount of stuff for you did you a good turn, and no mistake. I wonder
who it could be. No use asking Scadgers, he'd be as close as death about it;
indeed, if there were any hanky-panky, any mystery, I mean, he'd always swear he
was out whenever one called, for fear it should be bullied out of him.&quot;</p>
<p>Indeed, Mr. Pringle, not being of a very impulsive temperament, and not
having very much to think about, bestowed far more wonderment on the question as
to who could have been Mr. Prescott's anonymous benefactor than did Mr. Prescott
himself. That gentleman, in love over head and ears, simply thought of the
transaction as a means to an end; in any other position he would have bestowed
upon it a certain amount of astonishment, but now all he cared for was to avail
himself of the chance it had opened up to him. He had determined that, so soon
as he found himself unfettered by debt, he would inform Mr. Murray of his
attachment to his daughter, and ask the old gentleman's consent to their getting
married. He knew well enough that his own official salary was by no means
sufficient to maintain a wife--notably a wife, the daughter of a rich country
squire--in the manner to which she had been accustom; but he knew equally well
that the rich country squire would, in all probability, make a handsome
settlement on his daughter; and to this he thoroughly looked forward. Not that
there should be urged against him the least suspicion of an <i>arrière pensée</i>;
he loved the girl with all his heart and soul and strength; but as in these days
he would never have thought of riding forth into Fleet Street and proclaiming
her beauty and virtue, and challenging all who might feel inclined to gainsay
them to single combat,--in like manner, in these days would he never have
thought of marrying a woman without money. And this was the youth who would have
taken Kate Mellon in her unrecognised position, and, so far as he knew,
penniless! Yes, but Kate Mellon was his first love; those were his earliest
salad days; he has had much experience of the world since then, and is not
honester or fresher from the contest.</p>
<p>There was, however, no doubt about his love for Miss Murray and his desire to
see her, so he started off by the first train after business-hours on the next
day, and was whirled off to Havering Station. One may suppose that he had found
time to communicate the fact of his intended arrival; for he had scarcely
proceeded a few paces up the steep hill which leads from the railway to the
village before he saw coming spinning towards him a low basket-chaise drawn by a
pair of roan galloways in plain black harness. And seated in the basket, driving
the roans, was a young lady in the prettiest little round hat, and with the
nicest short sealskin jacket and the daintiest dogskin driving-gauntlets, who
gave the knowingest salute with her whip when she saw Prescott, while the groom
behind her jumped down and relieved the young gentleman of his portmanteau.</p>
<p>&quot;Punctual, sir, I think!&quot; was the young lady's salutation after she had
rescued the right-hand dogskin gauntlet from a prolonged pressure--&quot;punctual, I
think! I say, James, what on earth has brought you down again so quickly? You
didn't give a hint in your note.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You, of course,&quot; said Mr. Prescott, looking at her with the greatest
delight.</p>
<p>&quot;No, but really! Papa, when he read your note, said he was delighted to have
you again, and that he supposed you must have obtained some farther leave of
absence. But I knew that was not likely, and I felt certain you were coming on
some special business. Oh, James, there's no bad news, is there?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, my darling pet, no bad news,--good, splendid, excellent news! I'd tell
you what it is now, but I can't, because it's news that's impossible to be told
except with action; and if I were to take action, I should astonish the worthy
person who is sitting behind us, and who is taking such care of my portmanteau.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, James, how can you! You'll drive, of course. I can't fancy any thing
more horrible than seeing a gentleman driven by a lady. Now, Bagshaw, all right.
And so you won't tell me, James?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not yet, Emily, not yet; and yet I don't see why on earth I shouldn't.
Bagshaw seems to be paying the greatest attention to the landscape, and,
moreover, has established a wall of portmanteau between us and him of the most
satisfactory. So I don't mind telling you, that I have come down to propose for
you to your father, and to ask his consent to our marriage.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, James, I never did! And ask papa's consent, indeed! Do you know that
you've never asked mine, sir?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Haven't I? Well, then, darling, I'll ask it now. No, no what nonsense!
Bagshaw can't see under the rug, and I can hold the ponies perfectly with one
hand: give it me! So; and now about papa; what do you think? what do you
advise?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I--I think he won't make any fuss, James; he's always fall of your praises,
and he's not like those horrid fathers in books, who never will let their
daughters marry the people they love--I didn't mean to say that--I meant the
people who love them! But I think I'd speak to him after dinner.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;After dinner?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, you know, when you're left alone together. He's pleasanter then, I
think. And then you can come to me in the drawing-room and tell me all about
it.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Murray received James Prescott with the greatest cordiality; and when
dinner was over, and the cloth was removed, the old gentleman instructed Banks
the butler to bring up a bottle of the '20 and some devilled biscuits. Banks, an
old and faithful retainer, muttered something in his master's ear as to what Dr.
Harwood had said; on which his master told him to go to the devil, and mind his
own business. So the '20 was brought; and Miss Murray had half a glass, and then
retired to the drawing-room; and Mr. Murray bade his guest pull his chair round
to the fire and prepare for serious drinking.</p>
<p>Then James Prescott knew that the crisis of his fate was approaching, so he
filled a bumper of port, drank half of it, looked the old gentleman steadily in
the face, and said, &quot;I wanted to speak to you, sir.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All right!&quot; said the old gentleman, helping himself; &quot;speak on.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;About your daughter, Miss Murray, sir,&quot; said Prescott, beginning to feel
himself all aglow,--&quot;about Miss Murray, sir.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All right!&quot; said the old gentleman, with perfect calmness--&quot;what about her?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, sir--I--the truth is--that I--I've formed an attachment to her,
sir--she's--she's a most delightful girl, sir,&quot; said Prescott, falling into
hopeless bathos at once.</p>
<p>&quot;She is, James,&quot; said the old gentleman,--like the sphynx, 'staring straight
on with calm eternal eyes,'--&quot;she is.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She is, indeed, sir. I believe I may say that Miss Murray is aware of my
entertaining this notion, sir--and that--that she's not displeased at it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course not, of course not, James; what girl would be displeased at the
notion that a young fellow found her delightful?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Confound it! he won't give me a leg up, any how,&quot; said poor Prescott to
himself. Then aloud, &quot;If I could gain Emily's--Miss Murray's consent, sir, would
you have any objection to me for her husband?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, ha! ah, ha! James,&quot; laughed the old gentleman in great delight--&quot;got it
out at last, eh, my boy?--been beating about the bush this ten minutes. I saw
you, I knew what was coming, but I wouldn't help you. You're not so good at this
kind of business as your father would have been. The vicar would have had it all
out in a minute; and if the girl's father had said no, he'd have run away with
her that night. Desperate fellow Alan is--was, I mean; we're all stupid enough
now! And so you want to marry Emily? and you say, if she consents, will I? If
she consents?--nonsense, James Prescott! do you think I've forgotten that
alphabet? or that it has changed during the last forty years? It's just the same
as it was, sir, and I recollect every letter of it. You and Emily have
understood each other this long time. No, I've no objection to make. I'd sooner
your father's son would marry my daughter than any duke in the land. You've not
much money, but I've plenty, and none to care for but her. One thing, how much
are you in debt?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not a sixpence.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;On your honour?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;On my honour.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's enough for me! Your father knows of this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not yet, sir. I haven't mentioned it to him; but--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I have! We talked it all over when he was here. So you see we old people
are not so blind as you think us. Now, you're dying to go to Emily, and I'm
dying to have a nap. Let us oblige each other.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Prescott did not need a repetition of the hint. In the course of the next
two minutes he was in the drawing-room; and the selections from <i>Lucia</i>,
with which the piano was resounding, were suddenly stopped, and were heard no
more until the advent of the old gentleman caused a necessity for candles and
calm propriety. I do not think it is necessary for me to reproduce the dialogue
which was carried on during the interval. It was very silly and very pleasant;
perfectly easy to be imagined, and ought never to be described. Only one bit of
it is worth preservation.</p>
<p>&quot;Were you ever in love before, James?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Once, dearest; only once in my life.&quot; (If he had been the age of old Parr
instead of six-and-twenty, he could not have said it with more earnestness.)</p>
<p>&quot;And why did you not marry her?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It would not have done, darling. She was not of our grade in life. It would
have been a wretched business. She felt that, and told me so.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Poor girl, poor girl!&quot; said little Emily; &quot;I wonder where she is now!&quot;</p>
<p>Prescott did not answer. He was too full of his present happiness to think of
his former love, who was at that moment lying with her life's breath ebbing fast
away.</p>

<h5>&quot;WE KISSED AGAIN WITH TEARS.&quot;</h5>
<br>
<p>As Frank Churchill advanced into the dining-room in the fading light, he saw
Barbara standing by the mantelpiece. Her face was turned towards him, but her
eyes were dropped to the ground. She did not raise them as her husband entered,
but remained in the same attitude, while he stopped short as the butler closed
the door behind him. Frank Churchill was not entirely taken by surprise; he knew
that his wife had been staying with her friend Mrs. Schröder, and this fact
flashed across him when he first received Kate Mellon's summons: but he thought
that she might have left the house; that she might have gone probably to her
aunt Miss Lexden--at all events, that there was no earthly reason to prevent him
from obeying that summons, and going to one who had always understood that she
had a claim upon him. If his wife were there, it was not likely that he would
come across her. She had now been absent some weeks from her home, and during
that time she had not made the slightest sign, had not shown the least
contrition, the least desire for a reconciliation; had not made the smallest
advance in any one shape or way; consequently, she would be as opposed to any
interview as he could be, and would take care to prevent it. As opposed as he
could be? Yes; that was giving it a very definite range; he felt that he could
trust himself now under any influence. All that had been ductile within him had
gradually been growing hard and rigid; all his love and tenderness, his devotion
to and pride in his wife had gradually died out; his very nature seemed to have
changed: where he had been trusting, he had become sceptical, where he had been
hopeful, he had become doubtful; where he had been generous, he had become
cynical. All his good aspirations, his domestic virtues, seemed to have deserted
him. What his mother had fondly hoped, when the separation between husband and
wife came,--that her son would be restored to her as he was before his
marriage,--never had been realised. For the first few days, fearing the gossip
of the world, he came home regularly to the house in Great Adullam Street, where
the old lady had been reinstalled; dined, and remained at home during the
evening, until he went down to see the proof of his article at the <i>Statesman</i>
office. But while at home, he was any thing but his old self. In the bygone days
he had been full of chat and rattle, keeping his mother alive to all the current
gossip of the day, talking to her of new books, new men, new opinions. Now he
sat moody and silent over the dinner-table--moody and silent over his
meerschaum-pipe after dinner over the fire, resting his chin on his hand,
dreaming vaguely of the past, vaguely of the future. Then, after a little time,
he began to tire of the sameness, to want excitement and variety, and he
commenced to dine at the Retrenchment night after night, sitting long over his
wine in the coffee-room, then going up and sitting in the smoke-room until late
hours of the night. He never joined tables with any one at dinner; he never gave
or accepted any further courtesy with his friends than the interchange of a
short nod; but occasionally at night he would launch out into conversation in
the smoke-room, where he began to gain some renown as a sayer of harsh sayings
and bitter jests.</p>
<p>Yes, this was what remained of the genial, kind-hearted, easy-going Frank
Churchill. His friends were in despair. His mother, poor old lady, felt that the
state of things now was infinitely worse than when Barbara was in the home; for
then, though she only saw her son occasionally, she believed him to be happy;
but now she scarcely ever saw him at all, and knew him to be thoroughly
wretched. She had no satisfaction in keeping house for him; there was no use in
ordering dinner which he did not eat; in &quot;tidying&quot; a house which he did not look
at; in hunting up and hustling into order servants who might have been as
servile as Eastern slaves, or as insolent as American helps, for all their
master cared. The old lady's occupation was gone, and she knew it; she felt even
more than ever that her position was lost, that she could not hope to supply the
place of her who was absent now, however well she and her son might have got on
before his marriage; and she was proportionably miserable and disappointed.
George Harding too was greatly annoyed at Frank's conduct. His loyal soul
allowed that his friend had been hardly dealt by; but he contended boldly that
since Barbara's first false step, Frank had been entirely in the wrong. He
contended that the husband should have gone to seek his erring wife, and should
have endeavoured, by every means in his power, to bring her back to his home.
When you talked of pride and that sort of thing to George Harding in a matter of
this kind, he snapped his fingers loudly and said, &quot;stuff!&quot; There was no hint at
any crime, at even any lightness of conduct, was there? Well then, there was but
one course to pursue. When Frank distinctly refused to follow this advice,
Harding shrugged his shoulders and left him to himself; but when he saw the
dreary, vapid, aimless life that his friend was pursuing, the change that had
come over him in every way, he prayed for an opportunity of once more taking him
to task in an affectionate and friendly spirit. This opportunity had not been
given, and Harding could find no chance of fault-finding in his friend's work,
which, though horribly bitter and slashing, was cleverer than ever.</p>
<p>The noise of the closing door rang drearily through the room, and Barbara
keeping silence, Churchill felt it incumbent on him to speak. His throat was
quite dry, his lips parched and quivering; but he made an effort, and the words
came out. &quot;You sent for me?&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I did,&quot; replied Barbara, still keeping her head bent and her eyes downcast:
&quot;I wished to speak with you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am here,&quot; said Churchill coldly.</p>
<p>&quot;I wished to tell you that--that I have learned a bitter lesson. I wished to
tell you that, only to-night, only within the last few minutes, I have
discovered that I have been deceived in--in certain matters that have passed
between us--that I have done you--done you wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>Churchill merely bowed his head.</p>
<p>&quot;I was present in the next room when what has just passed there took place. I
was present, and I heard every word. It was by no chance, by no accident, I
heard it; I was there intentionally and for the purpose. When that poor girl now
lying there sent for you, I felt assured that I should gain the key to that
mystery which ruined our married happiness; I felt assured that I should arrive
at a solution of that mystery; and now it is solved. You, who know my pride, may
judge what fearful interest that question must have had for me when I descended
to such means to gain my ends.&quot;</p>
<p>Churchill bowed again, but said not a word.</p>
<p>&quot;I have heard it,&quot; continued Barbara--&quot;heard the story from first to last.
That poor stricken creature lying there, on what we both know to be her
deathbed, is ignorant even of my name far more of my relationship to you. From
her lips I stand convicted of my mistake; from her lips I learn that I have done
you an injustice. I asked you to come in here that I might acknowledge this to
you.&quot; For the first time during the interview, she raised her eyes; they met
those of her husband, which were cold and pitiless.</p>
<p>&quot;You are very good; but don't you think your admission comes rather late?
Pardon me one minute,&quot;--Barbara had made a sign as though about to speak,--&quot;I'll
not detain you more than one minute. I wooed you as humbly as any rightminded
man could, more humbly than some would think fit and proper; but let that pass.
Before I asked you to share my life, I showed you plainly what that life was; I
did not withhold one jot of its difficulties, its restrictions, its poverty, if
you will. I pointed out to you plainly and unsparingly the sacrifices you would
have to make, certain luxuries--little perhaps in themselves, but difficult to
do without, from constant use--which you would have to give up. I put before you
what I knew would prove (as it has proved) the fact, that, if you married me,
the set of people amongst whom you had always lived would consider you had
demeaned yourself, and would give you up. I pointed all this plainly out to
you,--did I not?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You did.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you, having heard it all, and weighed it as much as women with any thing
like heart in them do weigh such matters, agreed to link your lot with mine.
Good. We married, and I brought you to your home; not a brilliant home by any
means, not a fairy bower likely to catch the fancy of a young girl, but still, I
make bold to say, a comfortable enough home, and one out of which, mind you, my
mother--one of the common-minded, commonplace people so sneered at by your
superior race--removed, of her own free will, in order that you might be its
sole mistress. You follow me?&quot; he asked, for her head had drooped again and he
could not see her face.</p>
<p>She murmured some indistinct answer, and as he looked across he thought he
saw the trace of tears upon her cheeks.</p>
<p>&quot;What was the result?&quot; he continued. &quot;From that time out, you began to
change. There were great allowances to be made for you, I grant. The place was
dull, the house small, the furniture meagre; the persons amongst whom you were
thrown strange and entirely different from any you had previously mixed with.
But the house was your own; the furniture sufficient for our wants; the people
anxious to receive you kindly and hospitably, to make you feel welcome, to do
any thing for you for my sake. My mother, in some respects a peculiar woman,
came out of the semi-seclusion in which she had lived for years, to show her
regard for you; she wanted you to share in that wealth of affection which she
lavished on me; she wanted you to be as much her daughter as I was her son. Did
you respond to this in any way? No. Did you try to content yourself with the lot
which you had accepted? No. Did you, knowing full well how all were striving for
you, endeavour to accommodate yourself to, and make the best of, circumstances?
No, no, no! You sit moping and indolent in your house, leaving things to go on
as they best can; nursing your grief and disappointment and rage until you see
every thing through a distorted medium; you alienate my friends by your
undisguised contempt; you affront my mother by openly spurning her proffered
affection. All this you do, wilfully or foolishly ignoring the fact that in each
and every act you inflict a stab on me--on me, slaving for you, loving you,
adoring you!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Frank, Frank!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yet one minute, if you please; I will not detain you longer; I should never
have sought this opportunity,&quot;--Barbara winced,--&quot;but having it, I must in self
defence avail myself of it to the utmost. Not merely do you pursue the line of
conduct I have just described, but you forget yourself and annoy me in a far
greater degree. I am told of your constantly receiving visits from a gentleman
during the hours of my absence from home. I mention this mildly, and beg you to
hint to him to call at some other time. You are offended at this; and after a
discussion, I acknowledge I may have been hasty, and the subject is dropped. I
take you to a party where you meet some of your old friends; your spirits
revive; you are more like your old self than you have been since your marriage;
and you walk off; away from all the rest of the party, with this same gentleman,
with whom I myself see you in singularly earnest conversation. I again speak to
you on this point; you deny that I have any occasion for complaint, and I again
give way. And now what return do you make me for my kindness, my trust, my
confidence? You accuse me of receiving letters, which as your husband I should
not receive: and you demand to know the purport of the letters, and the name of
the writer. I give a general denial to your suspicions; but as to telling you
what you require, my pride--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, even you have pride, then?&quot; said Barbara, with a half-sneer.</p>
<p>&quot;Proper pride! my honour, if you will,--for my honour was pledged in the
matter--forbade it. Then, acting on a wild and miserable impulse,--without one
thought or care for me, for yourself, for our name and reputation,--you took a
step which has brought misery on my life. You left my house, your home,--left it
and left me to be the talk, the object of the gossip, and the pity of all who
heard the wretched story. Not content with that, you come to this house, and I
am given to understand that, since you have been here, you have been constantly
visited by the man I have before spoken of--Captain Lyster!&quot;</p>
<p>No drooping head now! Barbara is standing erect as a dart. Her cheeks dead
white, her lips compressed, her eyes flaming fire.</p>
<p>&quot;You have been told lies!&quot; she said; &quot;lies which, were it not to cure your
madness, and to show you how weak you are, and how mercilessly you have been
played upon, I would scorn to answer! So these dear delightful people have
started that story about me, have they; have tried to degrade me in my husband's
eyes by such a miserable concoction as that; and my husband has believed them.
It is only on a par with the rest of the generous sympathy they have shown me,
and like all the rest of their wretched machinations, it has some slight shadow
of a foundation. Captain Lyster <i>has</i> been here; has been here
frequently,--oh, you need not raise your eyebrows,--it was not to see me he
came. I will tell you, in self-defence, what I would not have mentioned
otherwise. Ever since Mrs. Schröder's trouble, Captain Lyster has been her
kindest and most active friend. Before she was married he took the greatest
interest in her; and it was only her father's incontrovertible desire that she
should marry as she did, that prevented him from proposing for her. More; when
you saw us walking together at that garden-party at Uplands, it was of Alice he
was speaking; it was to tell me of how her reputation had been imperilled by
false and cowardly reports, that he had sought me out; and it was to ask my
advice and assistance, to enlist me on her side, that he was so urgent.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How can I be sure of this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How can you be sure of it! Did I ever tell you a falsehood in my life? You
know perfectly well,--you would know, at least, if you had not been blinded by
ridiculous jealousy, springing from suspicions artfully sown,--that I am
incapable of deceiving you in any way.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What brought Captain. Lyster so frequently to my house, in the early
days,--before the garden-party at Uplands, I mean,--and why did he always come
when I was away?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Shall I tell you what I believe brought Captain Lyster so frequently to your
house, Frank Churchill? I did not intend to mention it; I intended to have
spared you. Mind you, he never said as much to me,--he is too true and too
honourable a gentleman to cast a slur on any one; but I honestly believe that
Captain Lyster's visits to me were paid through sheer pity.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pity!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ay, pity! He is a keen observer, a shrewd man of the world, for all his
vapidity and his drawl; and I firmly believe that he pitied me from his soul. He
had known me in other days, recollect; he had seen me when--well, there is no
vanity in saying it; you know it as well as I do--when I was thought and made
much of; when the world was to me a very light and pleasant place, in which I
moved about as one of the favoured ones; when I did not know what it was to be
checked or thwarted, and when all paths were made smooth for me. He found me
solitary, dull, wretched; in a dreary quarter of the town, which was utterly
unknown to me; my only acquaintance, people with whom I had not one single thing
in common,--people looking with horror on all I had been accustomed to enjoy,
and enjoying all I had heartily detested. He found me <i>triste</i> and low; he
thought I was becoming dejected and unhappy; not that I ever told him so, of
course,--my pride is as great as his; but he is, as I have said, no fool, and he
found it out. What did he do? In the most delicate manner possible, he tried to
rouse me, and to show me what source of happiness I had in my new position and
in your love. He was the only link between my old and my new life; the only
person I used to see, who went among the people with whom I had formerly lived.
Was it very extraordinary for a girl to ask news of those with whom the whole of
her life had been spent? I used to ask Captain Lyster for such news; and he
would give it me, always in the gentlest and most delicate manner; telling me,
of course, of gaieties that had taken place, but pointing out how silly they
were, and how happy the most fêted girls at them would be to settle down into a
calm happy love, such as--such as he thought I possessed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did he say all this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He did; and more--much more. Since I have been here, Alice Schröder has told
me that on several occasions when your name has been freely commented upon,
Captain Lyster has defended you with the utmost warmth, and with a spirit which
one can scarcely imagine so naturally indolent a man to be capable of
exercising. More than this: when the unhappy story of our separation became
public scandal, I, having hitherto refrained from speaking to Captain Lyster
about it, but knowing that he must now have heard all, was about one day to ask
his advice. He stopped me at once. 'Pardon me, my dear Mrs. Churchill,' he said;
'this is a topic on which I cannot and must not enter. The time will come
when--when it will be all happily settled again; and you would then very much
regret having discussed the subject with me. If it should ever be my luck to be
married, and I had--as undoubtedly I should have--a dispute with my wife, I
would lock the door until we had settled it, and returned to our usual equable
state. Not one living soul should ever be able to jeer me about a matrimonial
quarrel.'&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He was right; God knows he was right!&quot; said Churchill, bitterly.</p>
<p>&quot;And yet this is the man whom you have chosen to misrepresent in such a
matter. Believe me, that people unfortunately situated as we are, could have
found very few friends with the kind heart, the tact, and delicacy of Captain
Lyster.&quot;</p>
<p>And then Barbara, heated and fatigued with her defence, stopped, and her head
drooped again, and she was silent. There was an awkward pause; then Churchill
said,</p>
<p>&quot;You sent for me to--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As I have told you--to confess that I had heard the statement made in the
next room, and to admit that I was in error in imagining that those letters came
from an improper source.&quot;</p>
<p>Now was Frank Churchill's time. One kind word from him, and the misery of his
life was at an end. But with that strange perversity which not unfrequently is a
characteristic of good and clever men, he fell into the snare of saying and
doing exactly what he should not.</p>
<p>&quot;And you are prepared to come home--&quot; he commenced, in a hard voice.</p>
<p>&quot;Not if invited in that tone,&quot; broke in Barbara abruptly.</p>
<p>&quot;To come home,&quot; continued Churchill, not noticing the interruption,--&quot;to come
home confessing that you were entirely in the wrong, and that you had no shadow
of excuse for leaving as you did. To come home--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Stop, Frank!&quot; burst out Barbara, unable any longer to control herself; &quot;this
is not the way to win a person of my temperament to agree to any measures which
you may propose. To come home, confessing this and acknowledging that,--why, you
know perfectly that you yourself were equally to blame in the preposterous
jealousy which you showed of Captain Lyster! I will confess and acknowledge
nothing. I will come home to you as your wife,--to be the first in your
regard,--to devote myself to you; but I will make no pledges as to accepting
other people's interference, or submitting to--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In fact,&quot; said Frank, &quot;as to being any thing different from what you were.
Now that will not do. Much as--as I may have loved you&quot;--his voice broke
here--&quot;I would sooner live away from you than undergo the torture of those last
few weeks at home again. It would be better for us both that--well, I will not
say more about it. God's will be done! One thing, I shall be able to make you
now some definite allowance, on which you can live comfortably without being a
burden on your relatives or friends. Sir Marmaduke Wentworth is dead; and I
understand from his lawyer that I am a legatee, though to what extent I do not
yet know. I had hoped that--&quot;</p>
<p>He was interrupted by a soft knock at the door. Presently the door opened,
and the nurse put in her head, with an alarmed expression of face. &quot;Come, come!&quot;
said she; &quot;quickly! both of you!&quot; and withdrew.</p>
<p>Frank stopped, and motioned Barbara to pass before him.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, no!&quot; she exclaimed wildly, clasping her hands and looking piteously into
his face; &quot;not into the presence of Death!--we cannot go into the presence of
Death with these wild words on our lips, this wicked rage at our hearts! Frank,
Frank, my darling! fancy if either of us were summoned while feeling so to each
other. It is a horrible madness, this; a wild inexplicable torture; but let it
end--oh, let it end! I will pray for forgiveness; I will be humble; I will do
all you wish! Oh, Frank, Frank, take me once more to yourself!&quot;</p>
<p>His strong arms are round her once again; once more her head is pillowed on
his breast; while between his sobs he says, &quot;Forgive you, my darling! Oh, ought
not I also to implore your forgiveness!&quot;</p>

<h5>GOING HOME.</h5>
<br>
<p>The room lay in deep shadow, the lamp having been moved behind the screen. On
its handsome bracket the Louis-Quatorze ormolu clock ticked solemnly away,
registering the death of each minute audibly, and indefinably forcing itself
upon the attention of those sitting by, in connexion with the rapidly-closing
earthly career of the sufferer on the bed. She lay there, having again fallen
into deep heavy slumber, broken occasionally by a fitful cry, a moan of anguish,
then relapsing once more into stertorous breathing and seemingly placid rest. In
a large arm-chair close by the head of the bed sat Robert Simnel, his eyes
tear-blurred, his cheeks swollen and flushed, his lips compressed, his hands
stretched straight out before him and rigidly knit together over his knee. This
was the end of it, then; the result of all his hopes and fears, his toiling and
his scheming. Just as the prize was in his grasp, it melted into thin air.
Bitter, frightfully bitter, as were his reflections at that moment, they were
tinged with very little thought of self. Grief, unspeakable grief, plucked at
his heartstrings as he looked upon the mangled wreck of the only thing he had
ever really cherished in the course of his busy life. There lay the beautiful
form which he had seen, so round and plump, swaying from side to side in
graceful inflections, wit every movement of her horse, now crushed out of shape
and swathed with bandages and splints. The fair hair, which he recollected
tightly knotted under the comely hat, lay floating over the pillow dank with
death-dew; the strong white hands, against the retaining grasp of which the
fieriest horses had pulled and plunged in vain, lay helpless on the coverlet,
cut and scored by the gravel, and without an infant's power in them. A fresh
burst of tears clouded Robert Simnel's eyes as he looked on this sad sight; and
his heart sunk within him as he felt that his one chance in life, his one chance
of love and peace and happiness, was rapidly vanishing before him. Then the
expression of his face changed, his eyes flashed, he set his teeth, and drove
his nails into the palms of his hands; for in listening to poor Kate's
incoherent exclamations and broken phrases, Simnel had gathered sufficient to
give him reason to suspect that she had met Beresford, and that he had somehow
or other,--whether intentionally or not, Simnel could not make out,--been
connected with, if not the primary cause of, the accident. And then Simnel's
chest heaved, and his breath came thick, and he inwardly swore that he would be
revenged on this man, who, to the last, had proved himself the evil genius of
her who once so fondly loved him.</p>
<p>When Barbara and Frank entered the room together, Simnel looked up, and the
bad expression faded out of his face. He, in common with the rest of the world,
had heard some garbled story of the separation, and he saw at a glance that poor
Kitty's accident had been the means of throwing them together again, and of
effecting a reconciliation. What he had just heard from the girl's month of
Churchill had inspired in him a sense of gratitude and regard; and as he noticed
Barbara clinging closely to her husband's arm, as she threw a half-frightened
glance towards the bed, he felt himself dimly acknowledging the mysterious
workings of that Providence, which, in its own good time, brings all things to
their appointed end.</p>
<p>Frank and Barbara, after casting a hurried look at the bed, had seated
themselves on the other side; the nurse, tired out with watching, had drawn her
large chair close to the fire and fallen into that horrible state of nodding and
catching herself up again, of struggling with sleep, then succumbing, then
diving forward with a nod and pulling herself rigid in an instant--a state so
common in extra-fatigue; and Simnel had dropped into his old desolate attitude.
So they sat, no one speaking. Ah, the misery of that watching in a sick-room!
the solemn silence scarcely broken by the ticking of the clock, the crackling of
the fire, the occasional dropping of the coals, the smothered hum of wheels
outside; the horrible thoughts that at such times get the mastery of the mind
and riot in full sway,--thoughts of the sick person there being watched, doubts
as to the chances of their recovery, wonderings as to whether they themselves
are conscious of their danger, as to whether they are what is commonly called
&quot;prepared&quot; to die. Then a dreamy state, in which we begin to wonder when we
shall be in similar extreme plight; and where? Shall we have had time for the
realisation of those schemes which now so much occupy us, or shall we be cut off
suddenly? Shall we outlive Tom and Dick and Harry, who are now our intimates; or
will they eat cake and wine before they step into the mourning-coach, and
canvass our character, and be tenderly garrulous on our foibles? Shall we be
able to bear it calmly and bravely when the doctor makes that dread
announcement, and tells us that if we have any earthly affairs to settle, it
were best to do it at once; for it is impossible to deny that there is a certain
amount of danger, &amp;c. &amp;c. And the boys, with life before them, and no helping,
guiding hand to point out the proper path? Ah, Tom and Dick and Harry, our old
friends, boon-companions, trusted intimates, they surely would have the heart to
look after the children? And the wife, dearest helpmate, true in all her wifely
duties, but ah how unfitted to combat with the world, to have the
responsibilities of the household to bear alone? And then the end itself!--the
Shadow-cloaked from head to foot! the great hereafter! &quot;Behold, we know not any
thing!&quot; Happy are we to arouse from that dismal reverie at the sound of the
wheels of the doctor's carriage, and gaze into his eyes, trusting there to read
a growing hope.</p>
<p>The reflections of the four persons assembled round poor Kate Mellon's
sick-bed were not entirely of this kind. The minds of Frank and Barbara were
naturally full of all that had just occurred, in which they were most
interested; full of thoughts of past storms and future happiness--full of such
pleasurable emotions, that the actual scene before them had but a minor
influence. Simnel was pondering over his shattered idol and his dreams of
vengeance; while the nurse, when for a few seconds' interval between her naps
she roused herself sufficiently to think at all, was full of a cheering
consciousness of earning eighteenpence a-day more in her present place than in
one in which she had been previously. And then came the sound of the wheels and
the smothered knock, and then the gentle opening of the door, and Mr. Slade's
pleasant presence in the room.</p>
<p>He approached the bed, and surveyed the sleeper; crossed the room with the
softest footsteps, and asked a few whispered questions of the nurse; then turned
quietly back, and seated himself by Frank and Barbara.</p>
<p>&quot;How do you find her?&quot; asked the latter.</p>
<p>Mr. Slade simply shook his head, without making any verbal reply.</p>
<p>&quot;The nurse summoned us hurriedly about half-an-hour ago,&quot; whispered
Churchill; &quot;but when we came in, we found her in the state in which you now see
her; she has not moved since, scarcely.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Poor child! poor child!&quot; said Mr. Slade, plying his pocket-handkerchief very
vigorously; &quot;she'll not move much more.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is she--is she very bad to-night?&quot; asked Barbara.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, my dear,&quot; said the old gentleman, taking a large pinch of snuff to
correct his emotion; &quot;yes, my dear, she is very bad, as you would say. There is
a worn pinched look in her face which is unmistakable. She is going home
rapidly, poor girl!&quot;</p>
<p>The sense of the last observation, though he had not heard the words, seemed
to have reached Mr. Simnel's ears, for he rose hurriedly, and crossing to Mr.
Slade, took him by the arm and led him on one side.</p>
<p>&quot;Did you say she was dying?&quot; he asked in a hoarse whisper, when they had
moved some distance from the rest.</p>
<p>&quot;I did not say so, though I implied it,&quot; said the old man; then peering at
him from under his spectacles, &quot;May I ask are you any relation of the lady's?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, no relation; only I--I was going to be married to her, that was all.&quot; He
said these words in a strange hard dry voice; and Mr. Slade felt him clutch his
wrist tight as he went on to say, &quot;Is there no hope? You won't take amiss what I
say; I know your talent and your position; but still in some cases, a second
opinion--if there is any thing that money can do--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My dear sir,&quot; said Mr. Slade &quot;I understand perfectly what you mean; and God
knows if there were any thing to be done, I wouldn't stand in the way; but in
this case, if you had the whole College of Surgeons before you, and the
gold-fields of Australia at your back, there could be but one result.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Simnel bowed his head, while one great shiver ran through his frame. Then
he looked up and said, &quot;And when?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Immediately--to-night; in two or three hours at most. She will probably
rouse from this lethargy, have some moments of consciousness, and then--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And then?&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Slade made no direct answer, but he shrugged his shoulders and turned on
his heel. Silently he shook hands with Barbara and Churchill, then with Simnel,
placing one hand on his shoulder, and gripping him tightly with the other; then
he walked to the bed, and bent over it, peering into poor Kitty's puckered face,
while two large tears fell on the coverlet. Then he stooped and lightly kissed
the hand which lay outstretched, and then hurried noiselessly from the room. Mr.
Slade saw several patients that night before going to a scientific <i>
conversazione</i> at the Hanover-Square Rooms--a noble lord, who had softening
of the brain, and who passed his days in a big arm-chair, and made a moaning
noise, and wept when turned away from the fire; a distinguished commoner, who
had given way to brandy, and was raving in delirium; and a young gentleman, who,
in attempting to jump the mess-room table after dinner, had slipped, and
sustained a compound fracture of his leg. But at each of these visits he was
haunted by the pallid tortured face of the dying girl. At the <i>conversazione</i>
it got between the microscope and a most delicious preparation; and was by his
side as he drew on his nightcap and prepared for his hard-earned slumbers.</p>
<p>Slowly, slowly wore away the night: Simnel still sat rigid and erect; but the
nurse was sound asleep, and Barbara's head had drooped upon Frank's shoulder,
when suddenly the room rang with a shrill startling cry. In an instant all
rushed to the bedside. There lay Kate awake, but still under the influence of
some dreadful dream.</p>
<p>&quot;Keep him off! keep him off!&quot; she cried. &quot;It's unfair, it's cowardly,
Charley! I'm a woman and you hit so hard! Oh, Robert,&quot; she exclaimed, vainly
endeavouring to drag herself towards Simnel, &quot;you'll keep him off! you'll defend
me!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There's no one there, Kate,&quot; said Simnel, dropping on his knees by the
bedside, and taking her hand; &quot;there's no one to hurt you, my child.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was dreaming then,&quot; said Kate; &quot;oh, such a horrid dream! I thought I----
Who are these?&quot; she exclaimed, looking at Barbara and Frank. &quot;I'm scarcely awake
yet, I think. Why, it's Guardy, of course! and you, dear, who were so kind to
me. But how are you here together? I can't make that out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is my wife, Kate,&quot; said Churchill; &quot;my wife, of whom you were speaking
this evening.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your wife! ah, I'm so glad; I never thought of that; I never thought of
asking her who she was; I only knew she was, oh, so kind and so affectionate
with me; and it was because she was your wife, eh? Will you kiss me again, dear?
So; and again! What a sweet soft face it is! Ah, he's been so good to me dear,
this husband of yours; and I've given him such trouble for so many years. So
grave and so steady he's always been, that I've looked upon him as quite an old
fellow, and never thought of his marrying. I--I'm much weaker to-night, I think;
the pain seems to have left my side; but I feel so weak, as though I couldn't
raise a finger. You're there Robert?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, dear.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ay, I feel your hand-grip now! You must not mind what I'm going to say,
Robert; you took on so before; but you'll be brave now, eh, Robert? I--I know
I'm going home--to my long home, I mean; and I want to say how happy, and
peaceful, and grateful to the Lord, I am. I've often thought of this time--often
and often; and wondered--and I've often thought it would be like this, and yet
not quite in this way. You used to talk to me about my rashness, Guardy,--in
riding, I mean.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, dear Kate; and you always promised, and you never did, my headstrong
child!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, Guardy, I didn't, and yet I tried hard; but I hadn't much pleasure
elsewise, had I? Robert knows that; and I <i>did</i> so enjoy my work! I've
often thought it might come when I was with the hounds, and that would have been
dreadful! All the business and bother in the field, and carried away somewhere,
to some wretched place, where there'd have been no one near to care for me; and
now I've you all here, and that kind old doctor; and, oh, thank God for all!&quot;</p>
<p>There was a little pause, and then she asked in, if any thing, a weaker
voice, &quot;What's become of the horse? does any one know?--the horse, I mean, that
did this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He was taken home, Kate; so Freeman said. He's good deal cut; but--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, don't let him come to grief, Robert! It wasn't fault, poor fellow! He
was startled by the--ah, well; it's all over now! Don't frown so, Robert; I
ought to have known better. Lord Clonmel always said he had a temper of his own;
but I thought I could do any thing, and--Some of them will crow over this, won't
they? Those Jeffrey girls, who always said I was a park-rider, and no good at
fencing, eh? Well, well, that's neither here nor there. You know all about the
will, Guardy,--in the desk, you know? and what I said about your having--and
Freeman--and the men's wages; and--&quot;</p>
<p>As she spoke she sunk back, and seemed to fall asleep at once. The nurse, who
had been hovering round, advanced and looked anxiously at her, laying her finger
on her pulse, and peering into her face. Reassured, she retired again; and the
others, save Simnel, who still remained kneeling by the bed, resumed their
places. Then, stretched supine, and without addressing herself to any one, Kate
Mellon began to talk again. Fragmentary, disconnected, incoherent sentences they
were that she uttered; but, listening to them, Simnel and Frank Churchill
managed to make out that her head was wandering, and that she was running
through passages of her earlier life.</p>
<p>&quot;Ready!&quot; she said. &quot;All right, Dolphin! Now, band!--why don't they play up?
No hoop lit yet! Get along, Dolphin! Ribbons now! Stand up, man!--why doesn't
that man stand up? So; give him his head--that's it! Chalk; more chalk!--this
pad's so slippery, I shall never stand on it; and--that's better. Now we
go--one, two, three! All right, sir; all right, madam; told you I should clear
it. Ah, Charley! Hold the hoop lower--lower yet. What's he at? I shall miss
it--miss it! and then--Slacken your curb, miss, or she'll rear! So; that's
it--easy does it. Courage now,--head and the heart up; hand and the heel down!
Oh, he's jumped short!--he's over! he's over!&quot;</p>
<p>She gave a sharp cry, and half-raised herself on to the pillow. The nurse was
by her in an instant; so were they all. Her eyes opened at first dreamily; then
she looked round and smiled sweetly. &quot;Kiss me, dear,&quot; she said to Barbara.
&quot;Guardy! Robert, Robert! kindest, dearest Robert, I'm--going home!&quot;</p>
<p>Then, with tears streaming from both their eyes, Frank led Barbara away;
while, haggard and rigid, Simnel knelt by the bedside firmly clutching a dead
hand.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_41" href="#div1Ref_41">CHAPTER XLI.</a></h4>
<h5>THE DAY AFTER.</h5>
<br>
<p>When Mr. Simnel woke on the morning succeeding the night of Kate Mellon's
death, he felt a numbness in his limbs, a burning, throbbing pain in his head,
and a general sensation of prostration. He made an attempt at getting up,
thinking he would string himself into vigour with his cold bath; but he found
his head whirling--his legs shaking; and, after a severe shivering fit, he was
fain to forego the attempt, and to get into bed again. Then he rang his bell,
and told his servant to ask Dr. Prater to step round at once, and then to go on
to Mr. Scadgers, whom he was to bring back with him. The servant despatched, Mr.
Simnel lay back in bed, and endeavoured to give himself up to reflection. But
the events of the last twenty-four hours had been far too exciting for that;
still lay stretched before his eyes the crushed and mangled figure of his loved
one; still her last broken words rung upon his ears.</p>
<p>&quot;'Dearest, kindest Robert!' she called me that--my darling called me that
with her last breath. 'Dearest kindest Robert!'--the last words! never to see
her any more--never to hear her voice again! All over now; all--No, not all; one
thing to be done, and done at once --a settlement with Charles Beresford!&quot;</p>
<p>Simnel smiled very grimly as this idea came into his mind. It was not the
first time that the idea had occurred to him. As, bit by bit, he gleaned poor
Kitty's incoherent story, as he knelt by her bed, he had rapidly framed his
course of action, and indeed carried it out in his mind. He saw himself
thrashing Beresford in the streets--saw the row that would take place thereon
consequent, the desperate confusion at the Tin-Tax Office; and, through the
perspective, had a distant vision of a long stretch of sand on the Calais
coast--he and Beresford fronting each other as principals, a couple of soldiers
from the neighbouring <i>caserne</i> as seconds, and an army medical man looking
on. He knew that Beresford was a man of courage; but he thought that he would
probably refuse to fight in such an affair as this; therefore Simnel determined
that no option should be given. He would not have a friend of his wait on
Beresford with a challenge. He (Simnel) would pick a quarrel with him on some
frivolous pretext, and insult him in the street. That was what he had made up
his mind to do, and that was what he had intended to do that very day, if his
sudden indisposition had not prevented him.</p>
<p>Little Dr. Prater found his patient very restless and tolerably impatient.
&quot;Well, my dear sir, and how are we? Glad I was at home, and able to come round
at once. A fortunate chance to catch me, for there is a <i>great</i> deal of
sickness just now amongst the upper classes. The tongue? Thank you. The pulse?
Ah; dear me, dear me! as I feared--a galloping pulse, my dear sir, and a high
state of fever! Have you now--have you had any cause for excitement?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Simnel, shortly; &quot;I was last night at the deathbed of one very
dear to me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To be sure, my dear sir; how came I to forget it!--Miss Kate Mellon's. Oh,
my dear sir, of course I heard of it,--I hear every thing,--at least, I heard of
her being very ill--impossible to live. Slade attended, didn't he? Ah, couldn't
have a better man. One of the rough diamonds of our profession, my dear sir; not
polished, but--all here!&quot; and the little doctor laid his forefinger on his
forehead. &quot;And so she's gone, poor young lady! Well, well! Now, my dear sir,
it's my duty to prescribe for you the utmost quietude. The least bit of
excitement may be highly prejudicial; in fact, I would not answer for the
consequences.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;When shall I be able to go out?&quot; asked Simnel impatiently.</p>
<p>&quot;Go out, my dear sir! Not for several days--perhaps longer. I will send in a
nurse to look after you; for you must be carefully watched, and have your
medicines at stated times; and I'll look in this evening. Mind, my dear sir,
perfect quiet.&quot;</p>
<p>After letting out the doctor, the servant returned to his master.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Scadgers is here, sir,&quot; said he.</p>
<p>&quot;Then show him in,&quot; said Simnel, from the bed. &quot;Beg your pardon, sir; but the
doctor's last words to me was that you was to see nobody but the nuss.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are you the doctor's servant, or mine, sir? Show him in!&quot; and in Mr.
Scadgers was shown.</p>
<p>&quot;Hallo, sir!&quot; said that worthy, regarding Mr. Simnel; &quot;this is bad news to
find you ill.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There's worse than that, Scadgers; a good deal worse; as you'll hear. Your
niece,--Kate Mellon, you know,--about whom we've had all the talk lately--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ay, I know; at the Runner's--I know--well?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dead.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dead!&quot; repeated Scadgers, with a blanched face--&quot;dead! how? when?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Last night; thrown from her horse; had some row with a man named Beresford
in the Park; horse was frightened; bolted, and fell with her. It was this cursed
Beresford's fault, and--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What Beresford is it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Charles Beresford of my office,--Commissioner, you know. I'll make him
remember that day's work; I'll post him at his club; I'll horsewhip him in the
street; I'll--I'd have done it to-day, but for this--this cold.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Charles Beresford, eh? And it's him that killed my niece, is it? Horsewhip
him, eh? you won't be able to leave your room yet; it's more than a cold you've
got, if I may judge by the look of your face and the hot feel of your hands.
Charles Beresford, eh? Ay, ay! ay, ay!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm afraid you're right, Scadgers,&quot; said Simnel. &quot;I begin to feel deuced
bad, much worse than when I woke. And to be lying here while that scoundrel will
be getting safe away--out of my reach!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean, getting away?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, he's off to the Continent! I myself recommended him to go there, to lie
quiet until his difficulties blew over; and he'll be off at once,--to-night or
to-morrow.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Will he, by Jove! no, no! don't you flurry yourself, sir. I'll put a stopper
on that. Charles Beresford shall be here whenever you want him, I'll take my
oath. Excuse me now; look in and see you to-morrow.&quot; And despite Mr. Simnel's
calling to him, Mr. Scadgers rushed off at the top of his speed.</p>
<p>Mr. Scadgers, albeit of a stout figure, and ill-adapted for exercise, never
ceased running until he ran into his own office in Berners Street, when he sat
himself down and fairly panted for breath. When he had recovered a little, he
called to him the wondering Jinks, and said, &quot;How does Beresford--Charles
Beresford--stand with us?&quot;</p>
<p>The little man thought for a minute, and then said, &quot;About a
hundred-and-thirty-seven on renewal; due the fifteenth next month.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What's his figure with Parkinson?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Between eight and nine hundred; dessay more'an a thousand--renewals, judges'
orders, all sorts of things in that lot. Parkinson's clerk was here yesterday,
talking about it amongst other things.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very good. Now look here, Jinks; you jump into a cab, and bowl away to
Parkinson's as hard as you can split. Tell him the game's up; that I've just
learnt Master Beresford's going to hook it abroad. Let Parkinson, or his chief
clerk, ran down and swear this before the judge in chambers,--affidavy, you
know,--and then let him instruct Sloman's people to collar Master Beresford at
once.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You want this done?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Most certainly I do; and rely on you to have it done at once. Look here,
Jinks, you know me: Beresford must be quodded to-night!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All right; look upon it as settled.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And more than that: learn, if you can, who holds his paper besides
Parkinson, and to what amount; and bring me a list. Tell Parkinson that I've a
feeling in this beyond mere business, and he'll understand. And bring me the
list of the others.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Jinks nodded acquiescence and departed. As he went out of the door, Mr.
Scadgers rubbed his grimy hands together, and muttered, &quot;Better than all your
horsewhippings and shootings. Master Beresford's broke up root and
branch,--stock, lock, and barrel. I'll never leave him now until I've crushed
him out. Insult my poor niece, did he? better have put his head in the fire at
once!&quot;</p>
<p>That afternoon, as Mr. Beresford walked jauntily from the Tin-Tax Office, he
was arrested on the <i>ne-exeat-regno</i> affidavit of William Parkinson,
gentleman, attorney-at-law, and conveyed to the mansion of Mr. Sloman in
Cursitor Street, at which pleasant house detainers to the amount of nearly five
thousand pounds were lodged in the course of the following day.</p>
<p>Mr. Scadgers, going to communicate his cheering intelligence to Mr. Simnel,
found the portion of Piccadilly opposite that gentleman's door thickly strewn
with tan, and asking Dr. Prater, whom he met on the threshold, for news of his
patient, was informed that Mr. Simnel had a severe attack of brain-fever, and
that at that moment the doctor would not answer for the result.</p>
<br>
<p>According to appointment, Frank Churchill presented himself at Mr. Russell's
offices in Lincoln's Inn; Mr. Russell, whose firm had been solicitors to the
Wentworths from time immemorial, and who himself had enjoyed all the confidence
of the late baronet. The old gentleman, clad in his never-varying rusty black,
and still as desirous as ever to hide his hands under his coat-sleeves, received
Frank in his usual icy manner, and bade him sit down. &quot;I have here,&quot; said he, &quot;a
letter for you from the late Sir Marmaduke Wentworth, with the contents of which
I am not acquainted; but which refers, I believe, to the will, a copy of which I
also have here. Be good enough to read it, and see whether you require any
information.&quot;</p>
<p>Frank broke the seal, and read the following, written in a trembling hand:</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent: 50%">&quot;<i>Pau, Pyrenees, October</i>.</p>
<p>&quot;<span class="sc">My Dear Professor</span>,</p>
<p style="text-indent: 10%">&quot;Two lines, to tell you two things: I'm
dying--that's one; I've always honoured and respected, and recently I've liked,
you--that's the other. They tell me you're a deuced-clever fellow--which is
nothing to me. I've proved you to be a gentleman--which is every thing. I wish
you were my son and my heir; but I can't make you either. I haven't got any son,
and my heir is my nephew--I've no doubt a very respectable fellow; a parson, who
collects sea-anemones and other fifths, in dirty water and a glass-bowl--a
harmless fellow enough, but not in my line. All I've been able to do is to leave
you five thousand pounds, which Russell, or some of them, will see that you're
paid. Don't be squeamish about taking it. I owe it you. I never gave you a mug
when you were christened. My love to your dear wife. God bless you!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 50%">&quot;<span class="sc">Marmaduke Wentworth</span>.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p>When he had finished the reading of this characteristic epistle, he told Mr.
Russell of its purport; and heard from the old gentleman that the legacy named
therein had been provided for by the will. Then Frank returned to Saxe-Coburg
Square, and settled with Mrs. Schröder and Barbara that they should at once
leave for Brighton, whither, after poor Kitty's funeral, he would follow them.</p>

<h5>AND LAST.</h5>
<br>
<p>Mr. Simnel was very ill indeed. Dr. Prater looked monstrous grave, and began
to talk about 'responsibility;' so they summoned other two physicians high in
esteem, who exchanged snuff-boxes, and looked out of window together, and
examined Dr. Prater's prescriptions through a gold double-eyeglass and a pair of
spectacles, and agreed that his treatment of the case was every thing that could
be wished, and declined to commit themselves to any opinion as to whether the
patient might get better or not. Frank Churchill remaining in town until after
the funeral of poor Kate Mellon, and expecting some suggestions from Mr. Simnel
as to how and where the last rites should be performed, called on that gentleman
at his chambers in Piccadilly, and discovered the state of affairs. Then
Churchill, while he remained in London, took to coming every day to see Mr.
Simnel, and to learn whether any thing was required for him; and, coming in to
pay a farewell visit after he had seen poor Kitty laid in the grave, he met Dr.
Prater, and heard from his lips that in all human probability the actual danger
was past, but that it might be months before the patient would be himself again,
so dreadfully had he been weakened and pulled down. So Churchill went away in
better spirits, leaving his address at Brighton, in case Mr. Simnel required any
thing done which Churchill could do for him. Indeed Frank wanted a little rest
and repose. As though his own domestic worries had not been enough for him, he
had had to supervise the whole of the mortuary and testamentary arrangements of
poor Kate Mellon; and one other bit of business he had had to perform, of a
somewhat more pleasing character.</p>
<p>In coming back in all humility to her husband's arms, Barbara had made no
stipulations; but when, holding her clasped in his strong embrace, he was
talking of her return home, she looked up imploringly in his face, and said,</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, if possible, not to the old street! oh, Frank, let us retrench in any
way, but do let us leave that horrible neighbourhood!&quot;</p>
<p>All things considered, he too thought it better; and as Sir Marmaduke's
legacy had materially increased his income, he felt himself justified in looking
out for some pretty suburban place, and half his days had been spent at
house-agents' offices, and in explorations of houses to which he had been
remitted.</p>
<p>Mr. Simnel's illness did not concern himself alone, but reflected immediately
on the Tin-Tax Office. For at that eminent establishment things had been so long
dependent on the one man, that so soon as he was taken away, unmistakable
symptoms of collapse began to show themselves, and it seemed impossible that the
business could be carried on. For in the discharge of the business of the
Tin-Tax Office the grand thing was for every body to refer to every body else,
until the whole onus of setting the machine in gear, of supplying steam-power,
and starting the engine, fell upon Mr. Simnel; and when he was not there to
start it, it went off in a very lame and one-sided manner. This was perceived by
&quot;one of the public,&quot; one of those wondrous persons who, with nothing to do, are
always on the look-out to see Achilles' heel uncovered, or to spy the joints in
Atrides' armour; and the person in question, who had been overcharged
eighteenpence in a matter of tin-tax, and who had received, in reply to an
appeal, a letter from the Office in which the relative ignored the existence of
an antecedent, and the verb positively declined any connexion with the
nominative case sent the letter to the <i>Daily Teaser</i>, where it was found
so charming, that a leading article in the richest and fullest-flavoured style
of that journal was specially devoted to it. This article was much quoted; and
at the end of the week the subject was honoured by the <i>Scourge</i> with a yet
more ferocious attack. The <i>Scourge</i> article happened to be read by the
Treasury Secretary on Sunday morning as he was dressing, and that astute
official at once saw that something was wrong. Early the next morning his
private secretary called at the Tin-Tax Office and learnt of Simnel's
illness--learned moreover that he had applied for six months' leave of absence,
thorough and entire rest and change being reported as absolutely necessary in
the certificate. The next man, a political nominee, was worth nothing; and of
the Commissioners none of them had the least notion of business save Sir Hickory
Maddox, who was past his work, and Mr. Beresford, who had--well, there was no
doubt about it, all town was ringing with it--gone entirely to the bad on racing
matters, and was at very time in Whitecross-Street Prison. The Treasury
Secretary was in a fix; he saw that the matter was becoming serious; that the
Tin-Tax--an important department--was going to grief; that some member was safe
to ask a question about the mismanagement in the first week of the session; and
that therefore what he the Treasury Secretary had to do--and a deuced unpleasant
job it was, too--was to tell the Chancellor of the Exchequer how matters stood,
and wait for orders. The Chancellor of the Exchequer received the news with a
very bad grace; he was a nervous man and hated newspaper-attacks; he was a
strictly moral man and hated looseness of any kind. He told the Treasury
Secretary that Mr. Beresford must be written to to resign his situation at once,
or he would be removed; and he stated that he was thoroughly sick of nepotism
and 'influence' in the choice of nominees, and that a man must be selected to
fill Beresford's berth, on whom they might really depend for the working of the
department during Simnel's absence.</p>
<p>It was the result of these instructions that George Harding found himself in
Downing Street, in obedience to a strongly-worded invitation, glaring over an
old red despatch-box at the Treasury Secretary, and receiving from him the offer
of that vacant berth. It was the result of his own honesty and
straightforwardness that he declined it. &quot;It wouldn't do, Sir George; it
wouldn't do. I'm cut out for a newspaper-man, and nothing else; though I deeply
feel the honour you've done me. No; I must decline; but I know a man who would
be exactly what you require; who--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pardon me, Mr. Harding; I was only instructed to sound you as to yourself;
and--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pardon <i>me</i>, you know the man of whom I am speaking well enough; he
wrote those articles on the Russian question, for which Lord Hailey supplied the
material, and with which he was so pleased.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, to be sure; I recollect; what's his name? one may make a note of him, at
any rate.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;His name is Churchill. You'll find no better clearer-headed man.&quot;</p>
<p>Then George Harding went away, and for the first and last time in his life
exerted his influence, and requested the return of favours which he had
frequently granted. He must have been well satisfied with the result of his
work. Three days after Harding's interview with the Treasury Secretary,
Churchill, idling at Brighton, was telegraphed for to Downing Street. The next
week the <i>London Gazette</i> contained the appointment of Francis Churchill,
Esquire, to be one of the Commissioners appointed for levying her Majesty's
Tin-Tax, <i>vice</i> Charles Beresford, Esquire, retired.</p>
<br>
<p>Mr. Beresford, pursued with the most unrelenting animosity by Scadgers, found
himself opposed at every step,--even when, in sheer despair, he petitioned the
Court,--and opposed so successfully, that he was remanded for two years. This
period he passed in prison, and in cultivating the mysteries of racket, <i>
écarté</i> and <i>piquet</i>, in the two last of which he became a great
proficient. It is to be hoped that they will be of service to him on the
Continent, whither, having eventually obtained his release, he has repaired; and
where his gentlemanly bearing and knowledge of the world will probably enable
him to earn a very decent income from the innocent young Englishmen always to be
picked up in travelling.</p>
<p>Mr. Prescott married Miss Murray, and, for a time, lived in London, and
attended his office with great regularity. But the old squire found he could not
live without his daughter, and simultaneously discovered that it was absolutely
necessary that his estate should be more closely looked after than it had been.
So, at his father-in-law's desire, Mr. Prescott resigned his appointment, and
took up his quarters at Brooklands, where he and his wife are thoroughly happy;
and where he discharges his duties of shooting, fishing, and hunting, to his own
and his wife's great satisfaction. They have two sturdy children; a girl Kate,
to whom Mr. Simnel is sponsor, and a boy Jim, who, under the guidance of his
godfather Mr. Pringle, is already being indoctrinated into all kinds of
mischief.</p>
<p>Dear honest old George Pringle is still single. &quot;Time, sir,&quot; he sometimes
says to Prescott, &quot;has bereft me of charms once divine,&quot; laying his hand on a
bald place about the size of a shilling on the crown of his head; &quot;but I defy
him. I and Madame Rachel are the only people who are beautiful for ever.&quot; He is
very happy, having risen well in his office, and he still hates Mr. Dibb with
all the intensity of former years.</p>
<p>Mr. Simnel, after some months, came back cured of his illness, but quite an
altered man; his hair had become quite white, and his back was bowed like that
of a very old man. Occasionally he goes down to see his colleague Mr. Churchill,
or to spend Saturday and Sunday with Mr. Prescott's family; but his ordinary
life is a very quiet one, and seems divided between his office and the True-Blue
Club, in the card-room of which he is to be found every night prepared to hold
his own at whist against all comers.</p>
<p>Mr. Scadgers still pursues his trade; but I hear that he is now considering
the advances of a joint-stock company, who wish to buy his business, under the
title of The Government-Clerks' Own Friend and Unlimited. Advance Company
(limited), and who propose to make Jinks manager with a large salary.</p>
<p>There is no Mrs. Schröder now, and no house appertaining to any one of that
name in Saxe-Coburg Square. Captain and Mrs. Lyster live in a large house at
Maidenhead, known to their friends as &quot;The Staircase,&quot; from the enormous size of
the <i>escalier</i>, but really known as Wingroves,--a fine old-fashioned
Queen-Anne mansion, facing the river, where they are thoroughly happy. Their son
Fred is supposed by his parents to be a prodigy, and is really a healthy
pleasant boy.</p>
<p>Near them is a little cottage with a trim garden, passing by which in the
summer you will generally see a white-haired old lady, on a rustic seat, reading
a book and enjoying the sunlight.</p>
<p>Then comes a shout, a clanging of the garden-gate, an irruption of children,
wild cries of &quot;Granny!&quot; and the old lady is hustled away to find fruit or play
at games. This is old Mrs. Churchill, who has never been so happy in her life.</p>
<p>And Barbara and Frank? They live close by in a charming house, with a lawn
sloping to the Thames. Barbara has her brougham again; and all her old
acquaintance have called on her, and expressed their delight at her husband's
good fortune with great enthusiasm. Miss Lexden, now resident in Florence, and a
confirmed invalid, is perhaps the only one of her old set who has not so acted.
But Barbara has not cared to renew the old connexions. Thoroughly happy in her
husband, doting on her three children, her chief pleasure is in her home, of
which she is now the comfort and the pride.</p>

Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
